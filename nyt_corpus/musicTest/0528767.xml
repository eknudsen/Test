        <p>"Split and Slide," a song written by Butch Hancock, is the kind of tale that folklore is made of. It chronicles the rise and fall of two crazy characters from West Texas whose exploits and misadventures take them through small towns, into sleazy gambling joints, up and down mountains and in and out of love; at one point they try to rob a bank and wind up being hauled away on the back of a garbage truck. Split and Slide are contented losers: no matter how many times they fail to get ahead, they're always happy to try again. At the end of one chapter of the saga, they're back to playing music in their dumpy hometown cafe, plotting a new way to escape out the swinging screen door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hancock and Steve Young, two Southern singers and songwriters who will perform tonight at CB's Gallery in Manhattan and tomorrow night at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J., are a kind of real-life Split and Slide. Both have been playing country-folk music troubadour style for more than 20 years; neither has had much commercial success and neither seems to care greatly. Mr. Hancock grew up in Lubbock, Tex., and lives in Austin, where he has his own store, performance space and gallery called Lubbock or Leave It, a kind of modest mecca of Austin folk culture. Mr. Young has been recording solo albums since 1969 and has lived in Georgia, Alabama, Los Angeles, Nashville and now Austin.</p>

        <p>"Split and Slide," a song written by Butch Hancock, is the kind of tale that folklore is made of. It chronicles the rise and fall of two crazy characters from West Texas whose exploits and misadventures take them through small towns, into sleazy gambling joints, up and down mountains and in and out of love; at one point they try to rob a bank and wind up being hauled away on the back of a garbage truck. Split and Slide are contented losers: no matter how many times they fail to get ahead, they're always happy to try again. At the end of one chapter of the saga, they're back to playing music in their dumpy hometown cafe, plotting a new way to escape out the swinging screen door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hancock and Steve Young, two Southern singers and songwriters who will perform tonight at CB's Gallery in Manhattan and tomorrow night at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J., are a kind of real-life Split and Slide. Both have been playing country-folk music troubadour style for more than 20 years; neither has had much commercial success and neither seems to care greatly. Mr. Hancock grew up in Lubbock, Tex., and lives in Austin, where he has his own store, performance space and gallery called Lubbock or Leave It, a kind of modest mecca of Austin folk culture. Mr. Young has been recording solo albums since 1969 and has lived in Georgia, Alabama, Los Angeles, Nashville and now Austin.</p>
        <p>The pair have been on tour together since last month. "We're veterans of the road," Mr. Young said in a recent phone interview from a stop in Westboro, Mass. "Butch has a Jeep Cherokee. We're just out there putting miles on it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hancock got on the phone and said, "Good morning!" even though it was 9 o'clock at night.</p>
        <p>Both singers treat music not as a career but as a life style. They don't abide by the rules of the music business and as a result have remained outsiders. Their songs, like Mr. Hancock's "Split and Slide" or Mr. Young's "Seven Bridges Road," are highly literate, artful narratives about the romance of life on the fringes of society. Each sings with the grace and flair of a modern bard; as performers, they're less anomalies than they are proud bearers of the oral folk tradition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young was born on July 12, 1942. He grew up in Georgia, Alabama and East Texas, absorbing what he terms "the music of the South." "I heard music from the Baptist church, where I was made to go to for a while," he said. "I heard mountain music. A lot of people that influenced me were anonymous street singers in little towns -- usually black people but not always. I heard bluegrass bands. I also listened to the radio, people like Hank Snow to Hank Williams, until Elvis came along and blew it all out of the water."</p>
        <p>When he was in his late teens, Mr. Young bought a 1955 Buick and drove it to New York, where he absorbed the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1963, he went to Los Angeles and began working in different bands and as a session guitarist. By the end of the decade, he was involved with the growing country-rock movement and released his solo debut, "Rock, Salt and Nails," on A&amp;M records, with guest appearances by Gram Parsons of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gene Clark of the Byrds. Mr. Young said: "People didn't really know what to think of this music. A&amp;M said, 'Hey, this is country music,' and they sent it to Nashville. Nashville said, 'We don't think it's country music. We don't know what it is.' "</p>
        <p>Throughout the 70's and 80's, Mr. Young bounced around major and independent labels: Reprise, RCA Nashville, Mountain Railroad, Rounder. In 1975, Waylon Jennings had a country hit with Mr. Young's song "Lonesome, Orn'ry and Mean"; the Eagles recorded "Seven Bridges Road." Mr. Young's latest album, "Solo/Live," was released last year on the Austin-based label Watermelon. "I never was a good ole boy," he said. "I just was not a conformist. I like to be the outsider, the lone wolf. I've told people that if I had my way, I would only play one place one time. I would never go back. Just try to have a good night and then let it go." Briefly, a Band</p>
        <p>Mr. Hancock was born July 12, 1946. His father was a farmer and contractor on the West Texas plains, and Mr. Hancock has said his first songs came to him while driving his dad's tractor. Around 1971, he fell in with a group of songwriters, musicians and "metaphysical vagrants" that included Joe Ely and Jimmie Dale Gilmore; with their friends Steve Wesson and Tony Pearson they formed the Flatlanders. "Being brought up in Lubbock, all of us kind of drifted by osmosis to the same place in society, which tended to be the outsiders," Mr. Hancock said. "We had this great house called 14th Street. It was one of those bizarre places where people would come in and sleep for a few days and leave, and nobody could figure out who they were. 'I thought they were your friends!' 'I thought they were yours!' "</p>
        <p>The band soon drifted apart. (A Flatlanders album, "More a Legend Than a Band," was issued posthumously on Rounder Records.) Although Mr. Ely and Mr. Gilmore both have current major-label contracts, Mr. Hancock has never been offered one; except for a compilation, "Own and Own," on Sugar Hill Records, his recordings have been issued on his own Rainlight label. His most recent project was a 14-cassette release, "No Two Alike," recorded over six nights at an Austin club and including 140 of Mr. Hancock's songs, from "Split and Slide" and "West Texas Waltz" to "Boxcars" and "Split and Slide II," the second chapter of the saga.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hancock's lyrics are drawn as much from his experiences in Texas as from his sojourns all over the country and around the world. "We're constantly hypnotized and influenced by our environment," he said. "One time the Flatlanders were hanging out in the Tower of Pizza in Austin -- you know, a boring, little old tower of pizza. We all decided to see how bored we could get. And it wound up having exactly the opposite effect. We were all laughing hysterically within minutes. We could not get bored, no matter how hard we tried.</p>
        <p>"I travel to all kinds of crazy places, from the most apparently boring to the apparently exciting," he continued. "Everything is adventurous."</p>
        <p>Butch Hancock and Steve Young will perform tonight at CB's Gallery, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, in the East Village. Show time is 9 P.M.; tickets are $9. Information: (212) 677-0455. Tomorrow's concert at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street in Hoboken, is at 11 P.M. Tickets are $8. Information: (201) 798-4064.</p>
