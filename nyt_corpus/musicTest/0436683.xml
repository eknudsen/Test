        <p>Danny Gatton  The Ritz 119 East 11th Street</p>
        <p>Tuesday night's show at the Ritz, featuring the guitarist Danny Gatton and the New Orleans band the Radiators, was meant to be a night of American bar band music but turned out to be a night of sloppiness instead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gatton, an extraordinary guitarist who has developed a strong following, opened the show by enveloping a handful of musical styles with the assault of his clanging guitar. American pop music is often formal, but it runs on strong doses of anarchy; Mr. Gatton, who knows most of the American vernacular guitar styles -- blues, country, rock and some jazz -- is more than willing to push the limits of the genres he fools with. His improvisations sprayed out notes in clumps, let loose silvery runs that ended in bursts of shrill shrieks, and used a beer bottle to draw a harsh scream from the guitar.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gatton isn't a great band leader, and he and his band plodded along through blues and standards at numbingly high volume. The show closed with the Radiators, a mediocre bar band that tried some elemental group improvisation that at times seemed empathetic and supple. As it did with Mr. Gatton, the Ritz's sound system turned the Radiators' music into a clotted mess. But even that couldn't hide the routine mid-1970's approach to rock -- earnest, slightly regional and competent enough to form the background music for a Saturday night party.</p>
