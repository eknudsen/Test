        <p>LEAD: A committee composed largely of Broadway professionals recommended yesterday that two historic theaters included in the Times Square redevelopment plan be operated on a nonprofit basis for opera, recitals, dance, musicals and lectures.</p>
        <p>A committee composed largely of Broadway professionals recommended yesterday that two historic theaters included in the Times Square redevelopment plan be operated on a nonprofit basis for opera, recitals, dance, musicals and lectures.</p>
        <p>The theaters, the Victory and the Liberty, are among nine movie houses on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues that will be renovated if city and state agencies succeed with their ambitious plan for Times Square.</p>
        <p>''The role of the theater as an economic resource, urban renewer and provider of jobs is well established and will serve the 42d Street Redevelopment Project in good stead,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization and the committee.</p>
        <p>The committee, appointed by the Board of Estimate, said subsidies from the government, foundations or corporate sponsors probably would be required to cover the costs of operating the two theaters. It left unanswered the question of whether sufficient sponsorship could be found. No Plans for 5 Theaters</p>
        <p>Nor did the committee address questions about the future of the other seven 42d Street theaters that are to be saved. Two of them, the New Amsterdam and the Harris, are to be restored by the Nederlander Organization, a large theater concern, but plans have not been completed for five others.</p>
        <p>One of the seven, the Empire, on the south side of 42d Street near Eighth Avenue, has been set aside for use by the developers of a large tract across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Although city and state plans envision a mart and commercial complex on the tract, no agreement has been reached with outside developers.</p>
        <p>Experts said yesterday that they were encouraged by engineering studies that concluded that both the Victory and the Liberty could accommodate a wide range of theatrical events. They also said they were confident 42d Street would remain a vibrant center for the performing arts. Developers to Pay for Renovation</p>
        <p>''Three weeks after Times Square redevelopment is complete, people may not be excited about the tall buildings any more, but they'll be coming to see the theaters,'' said Tony Randall, the actor, who joined Mr. Schoenfeld at news conference to announce the results of the committee report.</p>
        <p>Both the Victory and the Liberty were designated for use as nonprofit theaters under guidelines adopted by the New York City Board of Estimate in 1983. The cost of renovating the theaters is to be borne by developers of four office towers that are to be built around the south end of Times Square.</p>
        <p>The Victory, the oldest theater on 42d Street, was built by Oscar Hammerstein in 1899. An engineer's report released yesterday said ''intimacy, architectural distinction and unique configuration make this theater special.'' It estimated renovating the Victory would cost $6.6 million to $7.7 million.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, built in 1905, was used before World War II for shows by Fred and Adele Astaire, George M. Cohan, Lynn Fontaine and Cole Porter. Its renovation costs were estimated at $7 million to $7.8 million.</p>
