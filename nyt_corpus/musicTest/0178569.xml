        <p>LEAD: When Harvey Lichtenstein opened the refurbished Majestic Theater last fall, two blocks from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it was perceived as a New York home for Peter Brook and other innovative theater directors. But now it is emerging as a concert hall and opera house as well. Pierre Boulez's appearances there in June with the Ensemble Intercontemporain proved the excellence of its acoustics, and now a number of other musical and operatic events are being negotiated, not the least of which are the Metropolitan Opera's Brooklyn experimental seasons, starting in 1991.</p>

        <p>In Manhattan, the Church of St. John the Evangelist at 55th Street and First Avenue has become a leading venue for evening organ recitals. Despite awkward sightlines, the church has established itself because of the unusually high quality of its Baroque-flavored Hellmuth Wolff organ and the impresario hustle of Donald Joyce, himself a notable artist and organist at the church. Recitals are scheduled for Oct. 5, Nov. 2 and Dec. 4. The church presents its International Organ Recitals series every Monday at 8 P.M. in May and June. Suggested contributions are $7, $5 for students and senior citizens.</p>
        <p>Church of St. John the Evangelist, 348 East 55th Street, 675-3652 or 753-8418.</p>
