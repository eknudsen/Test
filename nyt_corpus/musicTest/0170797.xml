        <p>LEAD: It was business as usual with a vengeance at the New York City Opera on Tuesday night.

        <p>LEAD: It was business as usual with a vengeance at the New York City Opera on Tuesday night.

        <p>It was business as usual with a vengeance at the New York City Opera on Tuesday night. Or at least one part of the company's business: Along with novelties new and old, and occasional up-to-date productions, the company seems to feel a mandate to present bread-and-butter repertory in stagings that are traditional to the point of defiant dowdiness.</p>
        <p>That description applies to last year's new production of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.'' Apart from some curious Expressionist touches in Clarke Dunham's otherwise conventional-ugly designs, the staging looks mired in decades-old routine.</p>
        <p>With productions this uninteresting, one's attention turns to musical values. In the pit, Sergiu Comissiona drew loud, symphonically opulent, but not very idiomatic sounds from the orchestra. On stage, Tuesday's cast offered several debuts or other changes from the season's first performance.</p>
        <p>In ''Cav,'' Pamela Kucenic made her debut as Santuzza. Miss Kucenic acted in the grand operatic manner apparently favored by Arthur Masella, the director, and sang with a sturdy, medium-sized, slightly veiled spinto soprano.</p>
        <p>Ned Barth, who is singing with the company for the first time in ''Pag,'' revealed a pleasant lyric baritone and a nicely rangy stage presence as Silvio.</p>
        <p>The most striking of the singers appearing for the first time in their roles was Stephen O'Mara, who stepped in as Turiddu in ''Cavalleria'' for Stefano Algieri, who had the flu. Mr. O'Mara has a beefy tenor that might turn strained and effortful later in his career. But right now it still has the bloom of youth, and his Turiddu was both exciting and suggestive of a budding Don Jose (a part he has already sung with regional companies), Radames or Canio.</p>
        <p>The Canio on Tuesday was Jon Frederic West. His big, bellowing heldentenor and wild-eyed acting can look and sound a little silly, but somehow they fit the inherent melodrama of this part.</p>
