        <p>LEAD: THE music of East and West is divided by common materials following opposite paths.</p>
        <p>THE music of East and West is divided by common materials following opposite paths.</p>
        <p>Thus contemporary Asian composers are often torn by a wish to enter the mainstream of European tradition - its particular instruments, forms of rhetoric and attitudes about how musical ideas grow and develop - and an even stronger need to protect and promote their culture's own specific use of interval and rhythm. Given the cross-purposes at play, it is not easy.</p>
        <p>This is what made Saturday night's evening of music at Alice Tully Hall by Ma Shui-Long, a Taiwanese composer, such an interesting affair. Mr. Ma's collection of pieces - including a string quartet, a flute solo, a Capriccio for Cello and Piano and an organ Toccata and Fugue - balanced the largely conventional use of Western instruments with the pure intervallic skips and pentatonic melody from his own culture - and it did so without descending into the usual cloying chinoiseries.</p>
        <p>How does he do it? Partly by letting his instruments speak in a European voice but with an Asian mind. Thus the traditional cello-piano format had a motionless quality. A single musical moment was not sent off in search of the next but rather held in the hand and turned over slowly for our examination. Even the wholly Westernized organ piece - a difficult one played with great flair by Walter Hilse -sounded curiously apart from Western style, thougn it is difficult to explain exactly why.</p>
        <p>In ''I Am. . .'' for soprano, flute and percussion, moreover, the swooping vowel sounds of Chinese - here dramatically enlarged by the singer Zoe Hwang - used Schoenbergian Sprechstimme as a point of reference without tainting its own distinctive timbre and sense of non-development. The more ambitious choral piece at the end - ''The Lament of Tou-Erh'' - followed a similar path. With its concerted sighs, moans, laughs and whispers, a debt to Penderecki is owed, but how true to the language of its narrative the music remains. Perhaps that is its secret -the undulating vowels and pointed accents of Mr. Ma's own Chinese that seem in his ear with every note he writes.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Scott was the forceful conductor of the Canticum Novum Chorale. Some of the other musicians were Sharon J. Wood, flutist, Mary Watt, oboist, Bion Yu-Ting Tsang, cellist, and Tian Jiang, pianist. Busiest among the evening's percussionists were James A. Neglia, John Godoy and Alan R. Michaels.</p>
