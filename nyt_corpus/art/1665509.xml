        <p>Ron English, a Jersey City artist, relishes his role as a so-called culture jammer. His work involves ''pirating'' billboards and then covering them with ads of his own that mock Coca-Cola, McDonald's, S.U.V.'s and other American icons. In all, he says he has pirated more than a thousand billboards nationwide, but he has rarely worked outside the United States.</p>
        <p>Last month, however, Mr. English traveled to Amsterdam, where Arte Vista, a gallery of Pop Art, was showing his work. The people who run the gallery also asked him to design a billboard that focused on the killing of Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker who was murdered last November after making a controversial film about Islamic culture.</p>

        <p>Art, Politics and Pirates</p>
        <p>Ron English, a Jersey City artist, relishes his role as a so-called culture jammer. His work involves ''pirating'' billboards and then covering them with ads of his own that mock Coca-Cola, McDonald's, S.U.V.'s and other American icons. In all, he says he has pirated more than a thousand billboards nationwide, but he has rarely worked outside the United States.</p>
        <p>Last month, however, Mr. English traveled to Amsterdam, where Arte Vista, a gallery of Pop Art, was showing his work. The people who run the gallery also asked him to design a billboard that focused on the killing of Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker who was murdered last November after making a controversial film about Islamic culture.</p>
        <p>Mr. English created an image of Vincent van Gogh, a distant relative of the filmmaker, wearing an Arab headdress, with the words, ''Jihad Is Over -- If You Want It.'' The gallery expected to put it up legally, but then ran into problems. One of the parties that was supposed to give permission had second thoughts and wanted a different image. Jan van der Heiden, the gallery owner, refused to change it. ''Art is not there to amuse,'' he said later. ''It's there to put a finger on a sore.''</p>
        <p>So, as usual, Mr. English went into guerilla mode, putting his work on several billboards, illegally. The gallery also posted 250 posters of it all over Amsterdam, including off a bridge. The police took that one down, but Amsterdam's government then provided a kiosk for the work. One Dutch province even plans to use the image in an anti-prejudice campaign. As for Mr. English, he is back in Jersey City, planning a billboard foray to Canada.</p>
        <p>He also plans to observe McDonald's 50th anniversary with a billboard -- look out, Ronald McDonald.</p>
        <p>The NJPAC Social Club</p>
        <p>It's Paquito D'Rivera's way of putting out the welcome mat. Mr. D'Rivera, a Grammy-winning saxophonist, clarinetist, composer (and North Bergen resident), grew up in Cuba in the 1940's and 1950's, which is considered the golden age of Cuban jazz. His father, the tenor saxophonist Tito D'Rivera, played with all the giants of Cuban music, like the percussionist Patato Valdes and the piano player Bebo Valdes and many others who would eventually come to the United States to continue their careers.</p>
        <p>But he never got to play in America with the trombonist Tojo Jimenez, who many think of as the father of Cuban-style trombone playing. Mr. Jimenez had remained behind in Cuba and stopped playing. But last year, he emigrated to Miami and is playing again. Paquito D'Rivera heard him and invited Mr. Jimenez, who is 87, to make his New Jersey debut at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. He will be there April 23, at 7:30 p.m., with a 13-piece Latin jazz band led by Mr. D'Rivera. The band will play only Mr. Jimenez's songs, with one exception: a piece Mr. D'Rivera wrote called ''Tojo,'' to welcome his father's old friend. Information: (888)466-5722.</p>
