        <p>A leading Picasso scholar says that hundreds of paintings and drawings made by the artist during the 1920's were inspired by an infatuation with the American socialite and jazz-age luminary Sara Murphy, and are not, as has long been thought, idealized figures or depictions of the woman who was Picasso's wife at the time, Olga.

        <p>A leading Picasso scholar says that hundreds of paintings and drawings made by the artist during the 1920's were inspired by an infatuation with the American socialite and jazz-age luminary Sara Murphy, and are not, as has long been thought, idealized figures or depictions of the woman who was Picasso's wife at the time, Olga. Among the works is the Neo-Classical masterpiece 'Woman in White' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>The assertion that some kind of romance took place between Picasso and Sara Murphy is made by William Rubin, the Picasso scholar and former head of the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, in 'The Pipes of Pan: Picasso's Aborted Love Song to Sara Murphy,' an article to be published in the May issue of the magazine Art News.</p>
        <p>'Confronting some several hundred images -- many of them patently romantic -- it was hard to avoid concluding that Picasso was mesmerized by Sara, indeed, enamored of her,' Mr. Rubin writes. He believes 'Madame Picasso,' a work in the National Gallery in Washington that Christian Zervos, the author of the complete catalogue of Picasso's art, once identified as a portrait of Olga, actually depicts Sara.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he says the monumental painting 'The Pipes of Pan,' in the Musee Picasso in Paris, a work that depicts two young males, began as a four-figure composition that included Sara in the role of Venus and the artist himself in the role of Mars, but that her rejection of him caused Picasso to eliminate Sara from it. New infrared photographs of the painting, he writes, support his conclusion that the composition began with a figure of Venus and changed radically. Secret Side to a Public Life</p>
        <p>'Picasso is so well known, yet there is clearly a part of his life and work that he kept secret and that he lied about to interviewers,' Mr. Rubin said recently in an interview in his office at the Modern. Picasso possibly misdated works depicting Sara to throw people, specifically his wife, off the track, said Mr. Rubin.</p>
        <p>By going through Picasso's vast output between 1921, when Picasso met Sara, and 1924, shortly after the infatuation ended, Mr. Rubin said, he can now associate hundreds of works with her. Many of these associations are hard to see, however, because Picasso tended to stylize or idealize his depictions, and sometimes blended portraits of different women into one. Yet Mr. Rubin insisted that after countless hours of looking at these works (in preparing an exhibition of Picasso portraits he is organizing at the Modern for 1996) he has little doubt that they represent Sara.</p>
        <p>He writes in the article that the Picasso authority Pierre Daix was long ago told in confidence by the artist that a painting from 1923 was a portrait of Sara, and that Honoria Donnelly, the Murphys' daughter, has known the same thing about certain drawings. But previously, no one, Mr. Rubin states, 'suspected the existence of the almost 40 oil paintings nor the more than 200 drawings of Sara that we can now identify.'</p>
        <p>'Indeed,' he continues, 'in 1923, pictures of Sara far outnumber those of Picasso's wife, Olga.' The Summer of '23</p>
        <p>Gerald and Sara Murphy were famous jazz-age figures: they were the models for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel 'Tender Is the Night.' They lived at the Hotel du Cap, just outside Antibes, France, in the summer of 1923, when Picasso was also there. Gerald Murphy had been trained as a landscape architect at Harvard, then had studied with the Russian painter Natalya Goncharova, as had Sara. It was while they were helping to repair scenery at the Ballets Russes in Paris in 1921, at Goncharova's behest, that Picasso may have first met Sara.</p>
        <p>Gerald became a Precisionist painter, along the lines of Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, whose proto-Pop depictions of consumer goods included products manufactured by the Mark Cross saddlery and design company, which his father owned. (In the 1930's, Gerald returned to the United States and took over the business.) He also collaborated with Cole Porter on the ballet 'Within the Quota,' a relationship Mr. Rubin hints may have been homosexual.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin suggests in the Art News article a scenario in which Picasso used his considerable 'animal magnetism' to woo Sara in Antibes during the summer of 1923 when Gerald retreated to be with Porter in Venice. Mr. Rubin stops short of claiming that the 'serious flirtation' between Sara and Picasso escalated into sex.</p>
        <p>In conversation, however, he is more inclined than he is in the article to imagine a romance. 'I don't know for a fact that anything happened,' he said, 'but my feeling increasingly is that it was a brief thing probably, but that it did happen. If she needed any rationale, it didn't hurt that her husband was off with Cole Porter in Venice while Picasso was courting her.' Hypotheses 'Convincing'</p>
        <p>The writer Calvin Tomkins, whose book 'Living Well Is the Best Revenge' recounts the lives of the Murphys, said in a telephone interview that he finds Mr. Rubin's hypotheses on the whole 'convincing.' But he added: 'I doubt if it was a romance. Picasso was seeing a lot of the Murphys that particular summer and he was very susceptible to beautiful women, as we know. Sara was a woman a lot of men fell in love with, including Fitzgerald, maybe Hemingway, too. I would imagine that she was more or less unaware of Picasso's infatuation, or very skillful at keeping it within bounds.'</p>
        <p>Mr. Tompkins did agree with Mr. Rubin about the identity of Sara in Picasso's art. 'I just went to see 'The Woman in White' the other day and you can certainly see Sara in the portrait,' he said.</p>
        <p>John Richardson, the Picasso biographer, also agreed with Mr. Rubin's analysis. He noted that in 1980 in Arts magazine, two art historians, Robert Judson Clark and Marian Burleigh-Motley, identified the source of the final version of 'Pipes of Pan' as a homoerotic photograph from 1901 by Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden, which Mr. Richardson said makes an interesting potential allusion to Gerald and Cole Porter. Mr. Rubin, when pointed to the 1980 article, said it added another piece to the puzzle of what he is calling 'the four-cornered triangle' of the Murphys, Picasso and Porter.</p>
        <p>The whole scenario has even led Mr. Rubin, hardly a pop-culture sort ordinarily, to wonder whether there might be a movie in it. The team of Merchant and Ivory is already doing a Picasso film, he discovered, based on the memoirs of Francoise Gilot. Still, Mr. Rubin has got in touch with Andrew Wylie, Mr. Tomkins's literary agent, who is shopping the idea around. 'I'm talking to people' was all Mr. Wylie would say.</p>
        <p>'When Pablo Met Sara,' anyone?</p>
