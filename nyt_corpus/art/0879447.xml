        <p>In a China that is rushing wildly toward its own idea of economic development, obliterating a good deal of its remaining cultural heritage in the process, some Chinese artists have found an unusual way of expressing dissent: they have begun looking backward, hoping that nostalgia can serve as a mirror, to remind the country that it has a past.</p>
        <p>Yet it is a measure of how quickly China is changing that this ''past'' may be as recent as two decades ago. It is also a past that in some ways is being romanticized, not to approve of what may have happened or to suggest that things were better then, but simply to recall that there is more to China than the current feverish drive for profits.</p>

        <p>In a China that is rushing wildly toward its own idea of economic development, obliterating a good deal of its remaining cultural heritage in the process, some Chinese artists have found an unusual way of expressing dissent: they have begun looking backward, hoping that nostalgia can serve as a mirror, to remind the country that it has a past.</p>
        <p>Yet it is a measure of how quickly China is changing that this ''past'' may be as recent as two decades ago. It is also a past that in some ways is being romanticized, not to approve of what may have happened or to suggest that things were better then, but simply to recall that there is more to China than the current feverish drive for profits.</p>
        <p>That, at least, is the premise of ''Reckoning With the Past,'' an intriguing exhibition of 64 works by 15 Chinese artists -- 9 from China and 3 each from Taiwan and Hong Kong -- at the Fruitmarket Gallery here. The show, which provides a rare window for the West on contemporary Chinese art, closes on Saturday, but it will travel successively to Aberdeen, Ayr and Kirkcaldy in Scotland through next June, and then tour other European cities for 15 months.</p>
        <p>''Contemporary artists' interest in the past implies a questioning of China's legacy of modernity,'' Chang Tsong-zung, a Hong Kong-based curator and expert in Chinese art, wrote in the exhibition's catalogue. ''Their nostalgia points to a yearning for symbols which rise above the vagaries of temporal political and economic forces.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps most surprising is the reappearance of Mao Zedong as a kind of Pop Art icon, portrayed in two paintings by Yu Youhan in a flowery Mao suit floating over assembled students and Red Guards. More ironically, Wang Xingwei has taken Mao's place in various heroic poses against mountainous landscapes, all evidently inspired by Liu Chunhua's famous propaganda portrait, ''Chairman Mao Goes to An-yuan.''</p>
        <p>Feng Mengo, a 30-year-old artist from Beijing, has found an even more unusual way of transforming the past, creating colorful video-game images of a Red Guard called Wang kick-fighting a blond American called Guile. In the process, he both trivializes and immortalizes the anti-American hysteria of the Cultural Revolution, which he is, of course, too young to remember.</p>
        <p>Graeme Murray, the Fruitmarket Gallery's director, readily admits that it is difficult to generalize about Chinese art today, above all because there is no conventional art market in China itself. Each of China's 21 provinces has a fine arts academy, but there are few private galleries or collectors, and the Chinese press gives scant attention to the visual arts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray said that he and Mr. Chang, who organized the show together, were nonetheless free to travel around China in search of talent. ''Shows tend to be held in private homes, art schools or hotel lobbies,'' he said, ''but we picked our own artists and no one gave us any trouble.''</p>
        <p>With this show, the Fruitmarket Gallery is continuing its series of exhibitions dedicated to Asia: it presented ''Liquid Crystal Futures,'' a show of contemporary Japanese photography, in 1994, and ''Information and Reality: Contemporary Korean Art,'' in 1995. The gallery's summer show next year, timed to coincide with the Edinburgh International Festival, will have contemporary Indian art as its theme.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes ''Reckoning with the Past'' from other, albeit very occasional, group shows of Chinese art is that it embraces artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as China. And while the artists from these three Chinas are the products of very different modern histories, the decision to unite them seems justified by their common search for identity at a time of convulsive change, including the prospect of Hong Kong's reversion to China's control next year.</p>
        <p>Although the paintings and drawings on display here are figurative, suggesting an urgency to communicate, the artists seem to have different concerns. ''China's artists, while dealing with personal experiences, cannot avoid addressing the public sphere,'' Mr. Chang said. ''For the artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a much more individualistic quest for identity and belonging.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, there is a dreamlike quality to some of the work from Taiwan and Hong Kong. In contrast, China's artists face both political constraints and the legacy of a 20th century in which the country has repeatedly rejected its past, starting with the fall of the last imperial dynasty in 1911 and continuing with the Communist revolution of 1949, the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 and the economic revolution of the past decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang said that during the Cultural Revolution, ''unthinkable quantities of historical artifacts'' were destroyed and Mao succeeded in severing ''any physical and sentimental ties China might have with its own history.'' But today's economic drive has also been ''catastrophic,'' he said, with ancient towns being wiped out by the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River and historic architecture being razed by rapid urbanization.</p>
        <p>No less alarming, though, is the apparent public indifference to what is now happening, an apathy that Mr. Chang attributes to ''the average citizen's alienation from his own past.'' In this sense, then, by trying to recreate the past in their own terms, the country's artists are making a strong statement about China's direction today.</p>
        <p>Zhang Xiaogang, a 38-year-old painter working in Chongqing, has focused on the legacy of collectivism through a series of photographlike portraits called ''Bloodline'' and ''Comrades.'' In these, the subjects stare out of the canvas conveying no visible emotion, yet each has a stain on his or her face suggesting an inner wound. ''The first lesson we have to learn is to protect ourselves and keep our experiences locked up in an inner chamber away from the prying of others,'' Mr. Zhang explained in a note in the catalogue.</p>
        <p>Different echoes of the past can be found in He Duoling's romantic portraits of early 20th-century Chinese women, in Mao Lizi's pictures of vandalized ancient Chinese images and in Yang Yiping's oils of solitary men, including ''Red Guard in Slumber,'' which was painted in 1988. Liu Dahong has gone even further, using surrealist images to recreate the ebullience of life in pre-Communist Shanghai.</p>
        <p>Some artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong, in contrast, seem to be trying to capture a more mythical China. Yu Peng of Taiwan has evoked ancient silk screens by painting traditional mountainous scenes peopled with strange figures. Lucia Cheung from Hong Kong has blended the old and new more literally, with ''Green Forest'' showing Hong Kong's skyscrapers peeping through bamboo trees.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the nostalgia evident in this show, many of the artists insist that their purpose is to look to the future. ''I hope that when people see my paintings they can dream of a better world than I have depicted,'' said Wei Dong, a Beijing-based artist who has placed women engaged in sadomasochistic activities in a traditional Chinese landscape. Mr. Liu is even more optimistic. ''My feeling,'' he wrote, ''is that, as China is again breathing the air of freedom, cultural revival will once more blossom in this ancient country.''</p>
