        <p>Brian Tolle  'Common Consent'  Basilico Fine Arts  26 Wooster Street  SoHo  Through Wednesday</p>
        <p>This is a minor disappointment after Brian Tolle's last show, which generated a buzz. Mr. Tolle again reconstructs historic Americana in hand-carved plastic foam. Last time it was a kind of Williamsburg, a wood-beamed trompe l'oeil interior that was just kitschy enough to evoke suburban Colonial Revival architecture. It was an amusing installation, affectionate toward the ambiguous forms, and a little spectacular.</p>

        <p>Brian Tolle  'Common Consent'  Basilico Fine Arts  26 Wooster Street  SoHo  Through Wednesday</p>
        <p>This is a minor disappointment after Brian Tolle's last show, which generated a buzz. Mr. Tolle again reconstructs historic Americana in hand-carved plastic foam. Last time it was a kind of Williamsburg, a wood-beamed trompe l'oeil interior that was just kitschy enough to evoke suburban Colonial Revival architecture. It was an amusing installation, affectionate toward the ambiguous forms, and a little spectacular.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Tolle has constructed various faux-stone walls in different configurations: a cross, a triangle, a circle (really a well), a pentagon and a line. They're matched with cryptic light projections -- a rifle supported by a finger stuck into its barrel, a bird on a hat, a colander and scissors -- that allude to 17th-century superstitions about witches and witchcraft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tolle is among the young artists (Matthew Barney is the best example) steeped in one or another branch of historical arcana to produce obscure, theatrical mythologies. There's a certain deadpan quality to the art and an obvious degree of eccentric craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>But in this case the results look too meager to heighten the idea of architecture as symbol: walls as emblems of social division, which the witch-hunters of New England most bizarrely enforced.</p>
