        <p>Ilan Averbuch  Nancy Hoffman Gallery  429 West Broadway (near Prince Street)  SoHo  Through Feb. 25</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to India, where New York City manhole covers are made, Ilan Averbuch, an Israeli-born sculptor, discovered the virtues of cast iron. And he has managed to work this solid, raw structural material into several vigorous sculptural arrangements. For the best of them, ''The River,'' he has cast in iron the goatskins used in India for carrying water; they take a kind of ghostly form of the animal itself.</p>
        <p>Two rows of goatskins are divided by a horizontal line of heavy stone paving materials. On the top row, the animal forms trot along right side up; on the bottom, they are suspended upside down in mirror image, like reflections in a river. A number of long ''bamboo'' poles, also cast in iron, support the entire structure, so that it appears to be on stilts.</p>
        <p>A preindustrial, primitive age is tellingly evoked, and it gives you a shiver or two.</p>
        <p>A very large piece, ''Air,'' is made of more conventional materials: wood, stone and glass. Taking the form of an inflated balloon lying on its side, its stone-capped wooden tail saucily flipped up, it's made of a gridded wood framework with glass panes. A playful caricature of a real hot-air balloon, it's appealing in its scale and klutziness.</p>
        <p>As a sculptor, Mr. Averbuch is not one for elegant refinements, but rawness is his strength.</p>
