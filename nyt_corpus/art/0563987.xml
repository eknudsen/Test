        <p>In "Catholicism," at Progressive Culture Works here, there are artists who would probably score higher than Sinead O'Connor on a Richter scale of sacrilege. But they will have to settle for the reaction of visitors willing to climb four floors in the Lorillard Building.</p>
        <p>The block-sized pile at 111 First Street has seen more than tobacco or art in its century-long existence, and at some point its owners evidently obtained a great buy in janitor-red paint. This they lavished on the portico, inner doors and stair railings.</p>

        <p>In "Catholicism," at Progressive Culture Works here, there are artists who would probably score higher than Sinead O'Connor on a Richter scale of sacrilege. But they will have to settle for the reaction of visitors willing to climb four floors in the Lorillard Building.</p>
        <p>The block-sized pile at 111 First Street has seen more than tobacco or art in its century-long existence, and at some point its owners evidently obtained a great buy in janitor-red paint. This they lavished on the portico, inner doors and stair railings.</p>
        <p>The rest of the decor is white except in the exhibition space, which has a high ceiling of dark wood supported by beams. During the reviewer's visit, the medieval effect was much enhanced by the preparations for a play about Spanish nuns, in which the actresses were taking obvious pleasure in their white coifs and black robes.</p>
        <p>Progressive Culture Works itself is an informal organization of artists, writers and performers, many of whom have their studios on the premises. Though lacking in officers, the enterprise does not want for moving spirits, one of whom, Nancy Mahl, organized this show and its predecessor, "Cannibalism" (so far, there are no plans for "Capitalism" or any other activity beginning with C).</p>
        <p>In her catalogue introduction, Ms. Mahl states: "For many of us, a rejection of the church's backward policies towards families and gay people has also meant severance from a larger cultural identity," not to mention "assimilation into a Protestant culture." Hence, the show represents not so much a return of lapsed Catholics to the bosom of the church as an effort "to examine and perhaps reclaim that identity" -- with or without the accompanying theology.</p>
        <p>The show is, by the way, dedicated to the late Corita Kent, who, as Sister Mary Corita, starred during the 1960's with silk-screen images radiating peace, love and an ecstatic kind of innocence. The one on exhibit here urges its beholders "to do a common thing uncommonly well" without hope of reward.</p>
        <p>Not all these Catholics have bones to pick with the church, but those who do pick away as if the Albigensians had never existed, much less the architects of the Reformation, John Calvin and Martin Luther. As far as humor goes, none compare with George Carlin and his invention, the ruler-wielding Sister Mary Discipline, but there are a few who manage to leaven the overall seriousness.</p>
        <p>One is Jeff Lundenberger, who says he wants to offend somebody with his work but not his mother, and shows a golden madonna studded all over with miniature babies.</p>
        <p>Another is Joseph Murray, who provides "ATM Confessional," a booth covered with red plush in which supplicants can get shriven by pressing a button that activates a sign reading "You are forgiven."</p>
        <p>Linda Churchill explains that she is "a recovering Catholic who is also recovering from being a woman." She celebrates both achievements with a box containing a nude doll that "bleeds" because of the nail that is driven into its vitals.</p>
        <p>In a similar spirit, Nick Mininko paints a naked madonna with an infant, a penis and a pair of high-heeled pumps. So much for Dada shock tactics.</p>
        <p>Bill Barrell writes about his mother, the Protestant, and his father, the Catholic, who elected to raise their sons and daughters accordingly, thus prompting the question, what if all five children had been of the same sex? Mr. Barrell's "Heaven and Hell," on unstretched canvas, addresses, he says, the issue of societies burdened by heavy-handed religions. But to this eye the cartoonlike images of stick figures, bombs and piles of skulls seem more an indictment of the wars that go with all faiths, except perhaps for Jainism.</p>
        <p>A religion that has lasted for nearly two millenniums is not easily demolished, especially not by artists absorbed with their own concerns. So it is not surprising to find that the better works are those that are either disinterested or else loyal to Catholicism.</p>
        <p>An example is Esteban Chavez's small woodcarving, reproduced on this page, which portrays St. Roche, the patron saint of plague and pestilence, and is one of the few moving images in the show.</p>
        <p>Eugenio Espinosa writes about his first communion and his desire for a "sense of life or spirit in fire" comparable to the "Pentecostal flame." In his shaped canvas, Mr. Espinosa depicts the fire in a kind of brazier flanked by flowers and leaves.</p>
        <p>Having acknowledged his start in the Jesuit school, Manuel Macarrulla insists that he "never got religion" but admits to finding "magic" in religious icons. He himself paints in flickering strokes an impression of St. Ann as a small statue.</p>
        <p>A painter and sculptor who, as a child, saw the Crucifixion as a "giant stop light on the way to the Kingdom of Heaven," Al Preciado contributes a floor-to-ceiling canvas, "Opulent Christ Floating." This is an expressionistic metaphor for a stained-glass window in which models' faces cut from advertisements replace the saints and over which are suspended gilded ceramic crucifixes and strings of pearls. Since Mr. Preciado's Pop humor is far from convincing, it does not detract in any way from the grandeur of his conception.</p>
        <p>Although the viewers looking to take offense will get some gratification from the show, most should find it an intellectually and sometimes esthetically stimulating experience.</p>
        <p>On view through Oct. 31, "Catholicism" is open from noon to 6 P.M. Friday through Sunday. The telephone number for further information is (201) 656-8329.</p>
