        <p>EIGHT-YEAR-OLD Molly Testwuide, a third grader at the Brookside Elementary School here, carries a camera around with her most of the time.  She takes pictures in unlikely places.  Shopping in the Limited store in Manhattan recently with her mother, Julie Betts Testwuide, a professional artist and photographer, and her sister, Emily, 10, she said: ''I looked up because I was bored. All of a sudden I saw a round staircase.''</p>
        <p>She snapped it, and the result is an abstract image that resembles the geometric intricacies of a giant seashell. She achieved this effect by smearing a wet Polaroid image with a wooden tool and coloring over it with pastels and colored pencils, a process called Polaroid manipulation taught to her by her mother.  Mother and daughter will both be exhibiting what they call ''painterly photographs'' at the New Century Artist's Gallery in SoHo in Manhattan through Jan. 31.</p>
        <p>Ms. Testwuide and Molly use several methods to achieve the Impressionistic effect that makes their photographs look like paintings by Monet or Pissarro. Through experimentation, Ms. Testwuide has come up with a process that allows her to create effects that depart sharply  from the original photograph.</p>
        <p>''The photographs in the show were taken with an old Polaroid from the 60's or 70's,'' Ms. Testwuide said.  ''This camera uses the only film that works for our process. Before the image dries we use wooden tools such as cuticle sticks to manipulate the emulsion to an abstract image.  We then reprint it and enlarge it onto watercolor paper and take it to the next step with colored pencils and pastels. The process is very new. I learned it was possible in a Polaroid workshop in the city, and I took off from there. I don't like color photos.  They look too real, too 'now.' I've spent years trying to change photos and have them look more painterly.''</p>
        <p>Looking over her photographs, a photographer friend said to Ms. Testwuide, who has worked in corporate and sports photography, photographed the New York Marathon from the highest point of the scaffolding on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and who is also a professional children's photographer, ''I didn't know you did paintings too.''</p>
        <p>This pleased her, she said, adding: ''I want people to have to look closely to see if the image is a painting or a photo. I'm an old-fashioned girl. I aim for a timeless quality in my work. I want people to wonder if the picture were taken 50 years ago or today.'' Many of her children's photographs have a dreamy quality. ''I have a closetful of soft, creamy dresses for the girls to wear so as to focus on their face and eyes.''</p>
        <p>''Manipulating photographs wakes you up to seeing things differently,'' Ms. Testwuide said.</p>
        <p>Molly added: ''You see it like you want to see it. And then what we do with it is kind of a secret.''</p>
        <p>In a self-portrait walking under trees where the shot was taken with a tripod and a timer, Ms. Testwuide used infrared film with a red filter to make the leaves white and then painted over it with transparent oils. In a self-portrait of herself twirling, which Molly set up and her mother clicked, Molly manipulated the emulsion on a wet print, then covered the reprinted image with the shimmering colors of France's Cote d'Azur.</p>
        <p>Both mother and daughter say they are absorbed by the creative process, although Molly hastened to add: ''I also play the piano, take dance class or I like to play with my cat, Nicky, or play football with my Dad. My Mom usually stays home from all that stuff. She's usually working on her photos.''</p>
        <p>On a family trip to France this summer, Ms. Testwuide, her two daughters and son, Kacey, 4, took pictures constantly. Their subjects were the Riviera and Giverny -- Monet's home outside Paris -- as well as the vineyards in Bordeaux.  Ms. Testwuide's husband, Kip Testwuide, an investment banker, said, ''Can we please have one dinner without photos?'' Nevertheless, Ms. Testwuide is almost obsessed with photographing wherever she goes.</p>
        <p>In their 3-story, 15-room, 1876 Victorian house here, Molly and her mother work on their photographs in a skylighted studio with double French doors and a Palladian window. A drawing table in the corner is covered in a melange of pencils in every color, boxes of pastels, trays of oil paints and artist's brushes of all sizes. In an adjoining anteroom are piles of art paper, sponges, toothbrushes and paints to make any budding artist's heart beat faster.</p>
        <p>''All the art supplies are at my children's fingertips for spur-of-the-moment creations,'' Ms. Testwuide said. ''I give them real canvas and real paints.''</p>
        <p>The three children and Ms. Testwuide work on a family sculpture, an unfinished wire-and- papier-mache structure of a person standing a foot and a half high in the corner of the studio. A blank wall in a large room with an indoor swimming pool will be adorned with five big canvas panels currently being worked on by the children in bright green, yellow, aqua, purple and hot pink.</p>
        <p>''The kids will paint on them with acrylics and make abstract paintings,'' Ms. Testwuide said. ''My 4-year-old son is the busiest artist of them all. He won't let me throw out any boxes. He goes to the garbage and pulls out corks. He is busy all afternoon every day making his sculptures and uses anything he can get his hands on. He is taken with tape and won't use glue.''</p>
        <p>An elaborate tunnel for his Ninja turtles is made of boxes and balsa wood and sits in his room.</p>
        <p>''My kids find great satisfaction in creating a final product they can savor and save,'' Ms. Testwuide said. ''It's not like a store-bought toy you just put back in the closet.'' A photography studio, gallery and darkroom are on a lower floor.</p>
        <p>''My Mom knows all the tricks and she has taught me some of them,'' Molly said. Her mother was mouthing Molly's words as she spoke. Molly laughed and said to her mother, ''Did you know you were saying just what I was saying?''</p>
        <p>In addition to the mother-daughter show in SoHo this month, Ms. Testwuide will be exhibiting her work next month at the Salmagundi Club in Manhattan and at Lyndhurst in Tarrytown. The number to call for information is 962-5096.</p>
