      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When Miguel Oks encountered a bleak windowless industrial building on the market in Long Island City, Queens, he saw promise for an art gallery and modern offices. Now, with two related art groups already committed to the space, the blocklong building is being gutted, and the $2.7 million project, including the purchase price of $1 million two years ago, is to be completed in October.</p>
        <p>The fortresslike building, where tops for Dannon yogurt containers were once made and which was later used by a jewelry manufacturer, consists of a 20-foot-high single-floor section and a three-story section. It is at 44-69 11th Street, between 44th Drive and 45th Avenue, a couple of blocks away from the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center.</p>

        <p>When Miguel Oks encountered a bleak windowless industrial building on the market in Long Island City, Queens, he saw promise for an art gallery and modern offices. Now, with two related art groups already committed to the space, the blocklong building is being gutted, and the $2.7 million project, including the purchase price of $1 million two years ago, is to be completed in October.</p>
        <p>The fortresslike building, where tops for Dannon yogurt containers were once made and which was later used by a jewelry manufacturer, consists of a 20-foot-high single-floor section and a three-story section. It is at 44-69 11th Street, between 44th Drive and 45th Avenue, a couple of blocks away from the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a very attractive minimalist concrete building with traces of its industrial past,'' said Mr. Oks, a partner with his wife, Bettina Weil, in Weil-Oks, the owner-developer.</p>
        <p>Up to 20 trees are to be planted along the building's 11th Street exterior. Its pebblelike concrete facade is to be reclad with panels of Eflex, a beige fiber-reinforced concrete material. In the new office section, glass blocks are to cover the first floor of the three-story facade. The second- and third-floor levels will feature windows that are 18 feet long and 6 feet high, providing natural light and views of Manhattan. The architect is Iair Rosen kranz of 5H Architecture &amp; Design in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Much of the gallery portion of the 44-year-old building is to remain windowless. ''Sunlight is the enemy of art,'' said David Dorsky, an owner of the Dorsky Gallery, specializing in contemporary art in SoHo. ''No windows was a plus.''</p>
        <p>Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Programs, a nonprofit organization for contemporary art, which is being set up in affiliation with the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz, negotiated a 10-year lease for 3,600 square feet of exhibition and office space. It plans to present four independently curated exhibitions a year and is soliciting proposals from curators, writers and critics.</p>
        <p>Separately, an art consultancy, the successor to the 38-year old Dorsky Gallery, which will cease to exist, has signed a 10-year lease for the 1,200-square-foot mezzanine level with clerestory windows and its own entrance. The Dorsky Gallery was founded by the late Samuel Dorsky, David's father.</p>
        <p>The remaining space, leasing for $20 to $25 a square foot annually, includes another 3,200 square feet of exhibition space with a skylight and 10,500 square feet of office space. David Inerfeld of Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot Realty was on familiar ground as the leasing broker. Over 20 years he had been involved three times in selling the building.</p>
