        <p>Chambers Fine Art  210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street  Chelsea  Through May 29</p>
        <p>Feng Boyi, who organized this show of eight Chinese photographers, says he hopes viewers will gain from it a deeper understanding of contemporary Chinese experience. But the artists he has selected, all born after 1960, show more interest in familiar formal or narrative photographic conventions than in real life.</p>
        <p>Four artists toy with the grid. Guan Shi's diaristic montages have one snapshot of himself or his immediate environment for every day of a given year; Lin Jingjing's ''My 365 Days'' has a picture of a plain bowl with some wispy hair in it, also for every day of the year. Ma Han's ''Plan of the Ants'' is a grid of small bird's-eye views of a busy city intersection. Bai Yiluo shapes grids of thumbtack-size portraits of ordinary people into the silhouettes of Chinese zodiac animals.</p>
        <p>Wen Ling's color pictures of anonymous people and street scenes printed end to end on long bands of paper also have the serial continuity and noncentered composition of the grid.</p>
        <p>The others construct narratives. Chi Peng's pictures of naked young men pursued by bright red, bird-size airplanes call to mind the surrealist photographs of Sandy Skoglund. Yi Deer's color pictures of himself in an entirely gold costume emerging from a cornfield or a street manhole are like updates of Tseng Kwong Chi's 1980's self-portraits as a Maoist tourist. Xu Lei's photographs of blue gauze curtains covering photographs of ancient statuary and buildings meditate on photography, history and the veils of perception.</p>
