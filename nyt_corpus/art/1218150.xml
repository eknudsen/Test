        <p>Reality is tricky business. Just how tricky it can be when photographers get their hands on it is on display in two summer group shows, ''Architectural Constructs in Contemporary Photography'' at the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo and ''Alternative Realities'' at the Laurence Miller Gallery in Midtown.</p>
        <p>Of the two, ''Architectural Constructs'' gives a fuller sampling of postmodern staged or set-up photography, which gathered critical mass in the 1970's and 80's and shows no signs of going away.

        <p>Reality is tricky business. Just how tricky it can be when photographers get their hands on it is on display in two summer group shows, ''Architectural Constructs in Contemporary Photography'' at the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo and ''Alternative Realities'' at the Laurence Miller Gallery in Midtown.</p>
        <p>Of the two, ''Architectural Constructs'' gives a fuller sampling of postmodern staged or set-up photography, which gathered critical mass in the 1970's and 80's and shows no signs of going away. Some stalwarts of this genre -- James Casebere, Robert Cumming and Nic Nicosia -- are represented here.</p>
        <p>The models Mr. Casebere has been creating for the camera are blank architectural scenes built out of paper, cardboard and other materials. His cerebral, pristine images of patently unreal structures have spawned other deconstructivist work, including that of Bernard Voita. Mr. Voita, who is Swiss, also constructs small models in his studio. But instead of taking sharp black-and-white pictures of his handiwork, he produces blurry ones that have a lonely documentary cast. An untitled 1995 photograph here evokes train tracks; a 1997 image is seemingly of empty cribs, a heavy, ominous shadow in the foreground.</p>
        <p>A model-builder who is carrying Mr. Casebere's deadpan views of everyday structures to new heights of make-believe realism is Oliver Boberg, a German whose work is also on view at the Paul Morris Gallery in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boberg is a painter as well, and in his superbly realistic models of nondescript familiar structures -- apartment buildings, roads, underpasses, stairways, walls and canals -- he gives his illusions of the banal a surprisingly elegiac veneer.</p>
        <p>Postmodern staged photography has come a long way since the time Mr. Cumming made his subtly subversive ''Straw House'' (1979) and Mr. Nicosia his wackily subversive ''Domestic Drama No. 4'' (1982). Mr. Cumming photographed a skeletal house built with candy-striped drinking straws. The straw house sits on a tray filled to overflowing with sprinkles that resemble pills, a mirror placed back of the house visually doubling the mess on top of a rough-hewn wooden table.</p>
        <p>In his characteristically cartoonish image, Mr. Nicosia shows a suburban couple standing on a floor-size blueprint of their dream house and having a shouting match. A child watches the fight, but a workman resting against a wall ignores the ruckus, as does a woman working at a drafting table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicosia's set-up is tame compared with some of the fiendishly complicated props and lights used by some artists before they took a single picture. For her off-kilter, neo-Cubist architectural studies of the 1980's, like the image of the Whitney Museum of American Art at Julie Saul, Barbara Kasten didn't just have on hand large custom-made oval and geometric mirrors that she positioned with care to catch certain elements that would offset other aspects of a building. Also on hand were a lighting consultant, electrical generators and a crew to handle the powerful lights fitted with colored gels that Kasten used to ''paint'' vivid colors on building facades.</p>
        <p>With its emphasis on cinematic splash, the Kasten image is a self-conscious triumph of style over substance. At first glance it seems this can also be said of the futuristic digital video, which is accompanied by a set of five Iris prints, produced by Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture, Canadian architects who work collaboratively as Asymptote in Manhattan. Their ''Iscapes 1.0'' (1999) -- an endlessly morphing digital work displayed on a small DVD player -- could be a delightful screen saver for the well-heeled.</p>
        <p>But even if it benefits from the allure of the new, this mesmerizing work -- and its sleekly, beautifully alien forms -- offers a glimpse of what it must have been like around 1900 when horse-and-buggy folks were suddenly confronted with the machine age and the machine esthetic.</p>
        <p>While Julie Saul emphasizes set-up photography, the Laurence Miller Gallery shows more computer-manipulated or computer-generated images. Here, some artists are clearly better at the computer than others.</p>
        <p>The computer-manipulated images by Peter Campus, done in the early and mid-90's and based on his own photographs of leaves and plants, are too-earnest exercises. Dennis Farber's ''Game Boy'' (1998) is overly familiar. A boy is intent on shooting a marble. Near or perched on some of the marbles are miniature figures of two women in swimsuits and a schoolgirl, all 1950's-style. Mr. Faber may be trying for some postmodern camp -- surrealistic montages of this kind were a staple of the 1920's -- but he hasn't improved on this overworked genre. Similarly, the Alexandre Castonguay head shots, which the Canadian artist created on his computer in 1997-98 by combining in each portrait the faces of several people, essentially echo Nancy Burson's computer composites of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the team known as Aziz &amp; Cucher has produced some of the most provocative and haunting computer-generated images. In their ''Interior Series'' (1998), Anthony Aziz and Sammy Cucher, who was found to have H.I.V. in 1989, have superimposed surfaces of the human body on architectural spaces.</p>
        <p>For her postmodern series here, Maggie Taylor scanned turn-of-the-20th-century cabinet portraits into her computer. She obscured the subjects' faces and gave them vaguely Gothic, overtly surreal props, like a fancy shell for a skirt, wings the color of kingfisher feathers or a bewigged ram's head. The results are enchanting, turn-of-this-century renderings of a fanciful past.</p>
        <p>The most unnerving and brilliant computer-manipulated images here are by Margi Geerlinks, who is Dutch. Her four color prints, roughly 30 by 40 inches, are spare and have a simple subject: the creation of parts of a human body.</p>
        <p>In an untitled work from 1997-98, a serene, barefoot young woman in a simple white dress is knitting the tops of a woolen pair of pants. But the wool covering a child's legs gives way to a child's feet.</p>
        <p>In the three other photographs, a  man with tousled white hair and wearing a white shirt sits calmly at a sewing machine. In one image, a boy missing his lower torso is sprawled in front of the sewing machine. In another, a headless body is at the machine, while the man appears to be on the verge of providing shoulders and a head. In these pictures, the young body to be worked on lies on a big white table. The provider of body parts is bathed in a glowing white light.</p>
        <p>With a minimum of fuss, Ms. Geerlinks seems to be making powerful allusions to breakthroughs in medical technology that allow for artificial insemination and the grafting back of severed limbs, to the way people in the industrialized countries are going to plastic surgeons for new faces and new bodies, and to the possible day in the future when human clones are harvested to replenish old or damaged or defective parts.</p>
        <p>''Architectural Constructs in Contemporary Photography'' is at the Julie Saul Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0747. ''Alternative Realities'' is at the Laurence Miller Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 397-3930. Both exhibitions continue through Aug. 18.</p>
