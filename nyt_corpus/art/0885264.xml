        <p>How's this for an art-world rarity? A public sculpture that no one wants removed.</p>
        <p>The piece, ''Pier Project,'' by Hans Peter Kuhn, the German composer and light and sound artist, is a long row of 9 plywood square pillars 81 feet apart, 15 feet tall, with each side 9 feet wide. Their painted surfaces seem to glow from within at night when they are illuminated by colored lights, which are at their base.</p>
        <p>The work, on Pier 32 just south of Canal Street in TriBeCa, also has a high-tech sound system that emits noises redolent of the waterfront, recalling foghorns, breaking waves and whale songs. Sponsored by Goethe House, the German cultural center, and the Hudson River Park Conservancy, the sculpture is scheduled to come down this weekend. It has been in place for about two weeks and has cost more than $100,000 to install and to run, said Reinhard Maiworm, the director of the program department at Goethe House. He added that the piece could remain in place if he could find someone to pay the $12,000-a-week maintenance, much of the money going to the renting and running of the sophisticated sound system.</p>
