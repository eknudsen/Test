        <p>Doug Aitken  303 Gallery  525 West 22d Street  Chelsea  Through Jan. 30</p>
        <p>Doug Aitken earns a living directing music videos; for art galleries, he creates video installations based on world-roving geographical explorations, including, for example, a visit to the infamous Jonestown in Guyana.</p>
        <p>One of two polished but over-complicated works on view here is a sequence of video projections designed to recreate a hike across an island in the Caribbean where a volcano erupted in 1995. Entering the darkened gallery, you first encounter a double projection presenting the artist's view as he follows a rocky stream through the jungle; in the next room, another double projection offers a meandering tour of a bleak, abandoned town. Finally, you arrive at a room where three projections surround you with a desolate volcanic landscape and fog. As a Conradian journey to the ends of civilization, this is haunting. But the artsy multiplication of views distracts from what's most engaging, which is the cinematic narrative.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Aitken's second piece, three monitors are arranged in the center of the room so that you can walk around them. Blending banality and mystery, they alternate views of semi-urban blight (car lots, commercial strips) and dreamlike scenes in which professional auctioneers, chanting numbers and commentary, stroll through empty spaces like a corporate lobby or an anonymous, institutional hallway. Mr. Aitken has constructed a theatrical environment for this work, including wooden benches, walls painted yellow and yellow-filtered skylights. But his formal contrivances are not so compelling that you don't wish he would just make a regular movie.</p>
