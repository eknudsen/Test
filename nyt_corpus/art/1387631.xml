        <p>''How to turn work into play? Build an Austere concrete sutdio, add romantic, 16-foot windows, books and a piano and start dreaming.'' Pilar Viladas</p>
        <p>It looks like a cross between an artist's studio and a really hip garage. This 20-by-40-foot concrete box is where David Wild, a director of television commercials, goes to work -- a short walk from the cozy Seattle residence that he shares with his wife, Lulu Gargiulo, a cinematographer, and their young daughter. ''It's really important to leave the house,'' says Wild, who has done ads for clients like I.B.M., Saturn and RC Cola, and who is known for his MTV series ''Ten Second Films.'' ''I've lived in lofts, and I hate seeing my bed when I'm working.''</p>

        <p>It looks like a cross between an artist's studio and a really hip garage. This 20-by-40-foot concrete box is where David Wild, a director of television commercials, goes to work -- a short walk from the cozy Seattle residence that he shares with his wife, Lulu Gargiulo, a cinematographer, and their young daughter. ''It's really important to leave the house,'' says Wild, who has done ads for clients like I.B.M., Saturn and RC Cola, and who is known for his MTV series ''Ten Second Films.'' ''I've lived in lofts, and I hate seeing my bed when I'm working.''</p>
        <p>Tom Kundig, a partner in the architectural firm Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen, relished the idea of making a space for Wild to think, work and play Satie on his Steinway concert grand piano. ''This is clearly about the creative process,'' Kundig explains, ''and the architecture is the backdrop.'' Some backdrop, with its 16-foot-square industrial sash windows, massive concrete walls, extravagant proportions and light, steel-lined stairwell leading to a mezzanine office, complete with fireman's pole for quick exits. The adjustable lights, which raise and lower from electric pulley wheels mounted on the ceiling, are strictly a guy thing. ''We toyed with the idea of a table that you could lower from the ceiling,'' says Kundig. The lights are a bit more down to earth, so to speak. Wild calls this brutalist-chic room of one's own his think tank, but he doesn't take it too seriously, noting with amusement that when a group of students toured the building, one of them remarked, ''This will make a great ruin someday.''</p>
