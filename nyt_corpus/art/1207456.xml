        <p>On Saturday, the Rothko Chapel will reopen after an 18-month, $1.8 million renovation, with the artist's paintings newly restored. Perhaps Rothko's greatest undertaking, the chapel with its seven plum monochromes and seven so-called black form paintings has probably never been closer to what he intended than it is now.</p>
        <p>Even the texture and color of the walls, newly troweled with gray plaster, is seductive; the overall effect seems to illustrate a point made by David Anfam, a leading Rothko scholar, about one of what the artist called his dark pictures. The painting, he wrote, ''proves the opposite of everything it seems at first to be: not simple, not monolithic, not static, not colorless, but ambiguous, organic, crafty, and sentient, albeit only in the eyes of an observer who is willing to meet its dark demands.''</p>
        <p>Although the paintings were finished in 1967, the octagonal chapel, commissioned by John and Dominique de Menil, did not open until 1971, the year after Rothko committed suicide. The timing made it easy to equate the somber paintings, so different from the bright canvases Rothko was known for, with despair.</p>
        <p>From the start the building, which houses an ecumenical chapel with a focus on human rights, had problems. The lighting was never right. The humidity could not be properly controlled. At one point, a blue tarp was stretched over the leaking central skylight to keep out the rain. And a large crack appeared in the west wall when foundation problems caused half the chapel to sink. More urgent, the paintings themselves were exhibiting premature signs of age, and the largest could not be removed for treatment. Originally installed through the skylight by a crane, they were too big to fit through the door.</p>
        <p>Finding solutions was made more challenging by a commitment to preserve Rothko's notoriously exacting vision. It took seven years, from 1980 to 1987, to complete the first treatment of the paintings. In the process, Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, chief conservator of the Menil Collection, gained an appreciation for the complexity of Rothko's art that borders on reverence. What she uncovered has lent momentum to a growing effort by scholars to change the common view that the dark pictures, which began to appear in 1957,  are simply evidence of depression.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro was asked to look at a mysterious white film that began to appear on the black form paintings only a few years after the chapel opened, almost nothing was known about how Rothko actually made them.</p>
        <p>After searching in vain for a conservator with the necessary expertise, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro found one of Rothko's assistants, Ray Kelly, who went to Houston to demonstrate how the painter worked. In the Menil Collection conservation lab, Mr. Kelly made small simulations of the black form paintings, showing how Rothko had mixed his own paint.</p>
        <p>The black form paintings, the largest of which is 15 by nearly nine feet, consist of large, hard-edged black rectangles painted over muted, rust-red grounds, with a narrow border of red left showing. For the red, as well as for the plum of the seven monochromes, Rothko used pigment dissolved in warm rabbit-skin glue, which produces a thin, transparent wash of color. The rectangles, a velvety, matte black, turned out to be an egg-oil emulsion: a concoction of whole egg, oil paint, dammar resin and turpentine, made fresh each day without a recipe.</p>
        <p>Although the contrast between the two kinds of paint appears subtle to viewers, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro concluded that it was crucial to understanding the dark pictures. The interplay of colors that was so important in Rothko's paintings of the 50's had given way not to morbidity, she thought, but to a more subtle interplay of surface qualities. ''I think he was really moving on to something very sophisticated here in dealing with reflectances, and the way light reflects off of a surface,'' she said. ''And that's what color is too, but I think here he was going beyond, dealing with how one perceives blackness and how one perceives borders.''</p>
        <p>The whiting, on the other hand, showed Rothko's second preoccupation: proportion. Because some areas were whiter than others, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro concluded that they must have more layers of paint. She knew Rothko had worked out the size of the black rectangles with charcoal on paper, pondering minute changes well into the night before having his assistants paint them on canvas the next day. The whiting pattern, which matched alterations Rothko made to working sketches, indicated that he made further revisions on canvas, which would explain the faint pentimenti, or traces, that remained visible in the paint even after the whiting was removed.</p>
        <p>The pentimenti were another clue. They showed what kind of imperfections the great perfectionist would tolerate. Pia Gottschaller, who received a fellowship from the Mellon Foundation to work with Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro on the restoration, said, ''They are there to a degree that made us think that Rothko, when he just finished them, must have been able to see them, and must have not minded.''</p>
        <p>For a time, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro theorized that the whiting was caused by dammar resin, which is known to blanch. But when she scraped off a tiny sample and sent it to scientists at Shell Oil laboratories, they determined that it was composed of fatty acids, probably from egg yolk, that had migrated to the painting's surface with the help of Houston's humidity. Even if the whiting were removed once, it would probably reappear.</p>
        <p>With the help of the Shell scientists and another conservator, Andrea di Bagno, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro came up with a chemical solvent. To treat the paintings, they turned them on their sides, the way they were when Rothko painted them. In a choreographed process, one woman would run a large piece of cotton batting dipped in solvent across the painting with a smooth, even stroke, and the other would follow with another piece of cotton, wiping it dry. The treatment worked, and in 1987, the paintings were reinstalled in time for the opening of the Menil Collection, a nearby museum also built by Mrs. de Menil. By the mid-90's, however, the whiting had returned.</p>
        <p>Just as Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro took care to preserve Rothko's surfaces once she realized their importance, the engineering team that worked on the lighting rejected simple solutions for fear they would alter the artist's vision. When the chapel opened, a curtain of sunlight overpowered the paintings. The easy answer was to stretch a diffusing scrim over the skylight. But the Menil team thought it was important to preserve a sense of time passing. The light inside had to be reduced, but it still had to change with the position of the sun. ''We could not change what Rothko knew to be the chapel,'' said Paul Winkler, director of the Menil Collection until last year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. de Menil hired Ove Arup &amp; Partners, the London engineering firm that worked on the Menil Collection and the nearby Cy Twombly Pavilion, both of which are noted for their use of natural light. After years of study, the engineers designed a compact baffle, with a hole in the middle that fits up into the skylight.</p>
        <p>In early 1999 the chapel closed for a major renovation. The baffle was installed, along with a new climate control system that should slow the whiting process. The sinking foundation was shored up by 55-foot piers. Before work began, however, contractors knocked a hole in the wall so the paintings could be taken to Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro's lab for treatment. In addition to removing the whiting again, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro and Ms. Gottschaller fixed some problems that may have been caused by early conservation attempts.</p>
        <p>Those early treatments, Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro emphasizes, highlight how uncharted the territory of conservation is. Usually, painting conservators can use varnish to hide irregularities in their work. But Rothko's paintings, like many of his time, were not intended to be varnished.</p>
        <p>''Working with monochromatic paintings, conservators don't have a lot of guidelines as to what we can accept,'' Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro said. ''And it's not just conservators, it's the art profession at large that has not really established a consensus of acceptable aging.''</p>
        <p>What's more, she pointed out, there are people who remember what the paintings looked like brand new. ''They look at the smallest problem, and they think the picture is ruined. That happens in every generation. I'm sure people felt the same way when they saw the cracks in the Rembrandts.''</p>
