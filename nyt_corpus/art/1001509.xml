        <p>As Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again. Yes, Susan Lucci has received another Daytime Emmy nomination for best actress, her 18th. Ms. Lucci, now an expert on accepting consolation, has never won. The actress, who portrays Erika Kane on the ABC soap opera ''All My Children,'' will learn her fate on April 15 when the awards ceremony is televised on NBC.

        <p>NEWS  Days of Hope</p>
        <p>As Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again. Yes, Susan Lucci has received another Daytime Emmy nomination for best actress, her 18th. Ms. Lucci, now an expert on accepting consolation, has never won.

        <p>Words and Music</p>
        <p>''Dead Man Walking'' will come up singing for the San Francisco Opera in the company's 2000-2001 season. Lotfi Mansouri, the general director of the San Francisco Opera, announced yesterday that he had commissioned the playwright Terrence McNally and the composer Jake Heggie to create an opera based on Sister Helen Prejean's award-winning 1993 book about the capital punishment system. In 1995, the book was adapted for the screen. Susan Sarandon's portrayal of Sister Helen won her an Academy Award for best actress. The ''Dead Man Walking'' opera project is part of Mr. Mansouri's ''Pacific Visions'' program for replenishing the opera repertory. Plans call for Patrick Summers to conduct the premiere and for the mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade to sing the principal role, the inmate's mother.</p>
        <p>Open Door Policy</p>
        <p>Judging a summer experiment a success, Italy plans to keep the doors of 16 popular museums open for an extra three hours a day for at least three years. Culture Minister Walter Veltroni said that beginning on April 7, the 16 museums, which open at 9 A.M. and close at 7 P.M., will remain open until 10 P.M. Among them are the Uffizi in Florence, the Galleria Borghese and National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome and l'Accademia in Venice. Attendance at Italy's museums rose to 11.9 million last year from 7.9 million in 1985.</p>
        <p>Now See This</p>
        <p>With a little help from his friends, Dustin Hoffman's life will flash before his eyes at a gala dinner of the American Museum of the Moving Image next Thursday in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. As the 13th subject of the museum's annual salute, the actor will witness scenes from some of his best films, introduced by colleagues like Kevin Bacon, Teri Garr, Barry Levinson, Katharine Ross and Justin Henry. A star of films like ''The Graduate,'' ''Midnight Cowboy,'' ''All the President's Men,'' ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' ''Tootsie'' and ''Rain Man,'' Mr. Hoffman is a nominee for an Academy Award for ''Wag the Dog.''</p>
