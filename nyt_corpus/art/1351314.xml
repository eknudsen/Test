        <p>Bellwether  335 Grand Street  Williamsburg, Brooklyn  Through Monday</p>
        <p>Painting looks healthy and hybrid in this show by three young artists from diverse backgrounds who all attended American art schools and share a penchant for artificial color and worked surfaces.</p>
        <p>Augusto Arbizo, born in the Philippines, who organized the show, produces nature-based abstractions with generous layers of colored dots and strokes organized in web patterns around a central core of light. Suggesting microscopic views of leaves, they also have a pulsing, visionary presence. Mala Iqbal, a first-generation American of Pakistani and German origin, seems intent upon using a separate technique for each element in her hallucinatory landscapes: spray paint, sponging, stippling, trompe l'oeil. This is not an unusual ploy these days, but Ms. Iqbal uses it in a loose, unfinicky way, achieving a vibrant density (''Fence Graffiti'') when she doesn't go overboard (''Hungry Wolf Pack'').</p>
        <p>Semina√Øve renderings of stylish interiors, which are the specialty of Kanishka Raja, also belong to a familiar genre (as seen in the work of Thomas Trosch, Dexter Dalwood and others). But Mr. Raja, who was born in Calcutta, adds especially high-key colors, jazzy patterns and spatial surprises like the Ruscha-like landscape in ''Cowboy and the Indian.'' Over all this show provides a good visual workout and makes one look forward to future efforts. Already Ms. Iqbal is showing several of hers in ''Yellow Brick Road,'' an exhibition at White Columns in Chelsea.</p>
