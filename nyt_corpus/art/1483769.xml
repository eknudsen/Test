        <p>Jenny Saville's plus-size expressionistic pictures of naked, corpulent female bodies have given figurative painting a good shot in the arm. This 32-year-old London artist has tended to hedge her bets by means of abstraction.

        <p>Gagosian Gallery  555 West 24th Street  Chelsea  Through May 3</p>
        <p>Jenny Saville's plus-size expressionistic pictures of naked, corpulent female bodies have given figurative painting a good shot in the arm. This 32-year-old London artist has tended to hedge her bets by means of abstraction. Here, in a full-figure self-portrait, the rude effect of the spread-eagled, forward thrusting naked pelvis is mitigated by Cubist fragmentation produced by mirrors surrounding the figure.</p>
        <p>With her five other canvases Ms. Saville shifts into melodramatic overdrive. Two paintings frame the artist's head lying on its side like a big boulder. One, in dank shades of bluish gray, looks like the head of a corpse. The other, in reds and tans, depicts her with glistening eyes and open, bruised mouth, as though resting from a domestic beating.</p>
        <p>Derived from photographs, these paintings have a vivid illusionism that the painterly action simultaneously abstracts and enhances. Slashing, smearing, staining and drizzling, the artist conjures a desperate mood; it's as though the paintings were made from the artist's own bodily fluids.</p>
        <p>These works are not exactly funny, but the sensational hyperbole borders on comedy. A huge 15-foot-wide picture of a dead pig's body painted in bloody red suggests a move away from the clinical realism of Lucian Freud toward the seriocomic horror of Francis Bacon. A picture of a screaming woman, her face seemingly bathed in blood, might be an homage to his screaming pope.</p>
        <p>Ms. Saville's paintings lend themselves to feminist interpretation. But what is more interesting is the fraught relationship between the macho formal dimensions and the content of brutalized femininity.</p>
