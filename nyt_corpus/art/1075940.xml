        <p>THE painter J. Alden Weir -- who would become known as a pioneer of American Impressionism -- got an offer in 1882 that would change the course of his life, and that of American art as well.</p>
        <p>Weir had just bought a painting for $560. An art collector in New York, Erwin Davis, took one look at the painting and offered him a 153-acre farm in the Branchville section of western Connecticut in exchange. Weir already owned land in the Adirondacks and tended to view nature, as many artists of his time did, as grandiose and unspoiled wilderness. But he was drawn to the modest-scale scenery in Branchville -- the meadows of corn and grass, the apple trees, the rocky terrain, the stone walls, the English-style barns and the small red Greek Revival farmhouse. He agreed to the deal.</p>
        <p>From that swap was born the Weir Farm National Historic Site in Branchville, on the Ridgefield-Wilton line. Weir Farm -- the only historic site of its kind in the state, and its only national park -- became a cradle of American Impressionism.</p>
        <p>John Twachtman and Childe Hassam trekked to Branchville, as did John Singer Sargent and Albert Pinkham Ryder. After Weir's death, his daughter, Dorothy Weir, also a painter, lived at the farm with her husband, the sculptor Mahonri Young. They were followed by Sperry and Doris Andrews, the current artists in residence, who arrived in 1957.</p>
        <p>Artists still set up easels all over the farm, often painting or sketching at the same vantage points that inspired Weir. Robert Dente, of West Hartford, who was a visiting artist last year, said: ''You can compare the reality to the master's response to that very scene.'' Tourists, art lovers and history buffs may view Weir's studiom with easel and other memorabilia.</p>
        <p>But Weir Farm has not been mothballed as most traditional museum settings are, according to Cliff Laube, a Park Ranger. The fact it has been home to artists continuously for more than a century, he said, accounts for its remarkable state of preservation. The only changes have been fashioned by nature itself -- there are more trees now as woodlands replace farm lands gradually discarded.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, Weir Farm, now surrounded by houses, has been saved from  even more development through the efforts  of concerned citizens and Weir's descendants. The houses, studios, barns and stone walls remain. Two gardens have been restored as closely as possible to their original state by the Ridgefield and Wilton garden clubs. In 1990, the farm was incorporated into the National Park Service, which along with the Weir Farm Trust is now responsible for maintaining the property. But more help was sought.</p>
        <p>In October, Congress stepped in, authorizing the expansion of Weir Farm with the acquisition of up to 15 more acres in Ridgefield. An exhibition hall and a new visitors' center and administrative offices are planned. ''We didn't want to alter the integrity of the landscape by putting up a building that was not here before,'' said Sarah Olson, the Weir Farm superintendent. ''We want people to see the farm as Weir himself saw and loved it.''</p>
        <p>What Weir saw at Branchville so captivated him that he and his bride, Anna, cut short their European honeymoon to return to the ''quiet, plain little house among the rocks'' as he described it. In 1885, Weir built a studio at the highest point on his land; the property in the Adirondacks was forsaken.</p>
        <p>In the early years, two crucial elements were still missing from Weir's esthetic vision: Impressionism itself and a love of landscape painting.</p>
        <p>Weir adopted a traditional approach, influenced it is said by the precise draftsmanship of his father, Robert W. Weir, a painter and a drawing instructor at West Point. And, in the 1870's, when the younger Weir went to Paris to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts he was dismayed by the new-fangled and controversial Impressionist revolution he found there. After visiting an exhibition of Impressionist works in Paris in 1877, Weir expressed outrage. ''A chamber of horrors,'' he wrote to his parents; he fled the hall with a headache.</p>
        <p>When Weir returned to the United States he acquired a reputation for consummate portraits and still lifes. But he would spend months away from his New York home, usually from May into late fall, in Branchville. And he took a hands-on interest in farming. Still, he kept landscape painting at arm's length; he said he had to really know the countryside first.</p>
        <p>Little by little the homespun quality of the Branchville's surroundings and the tranquillity of family life there began to inspire him. He painted the laundry hanging out to dry, a fishing party, stone walls, the golden meadows, the fruit trees, the farm hands  and his wife and daughters in repose -- or feeding the chickens. Not for him were heroic canvases of rugged mountains and rushing rivers. Weir's muted grays and greens offer a therapeutic experience.</p>
        <p>Now Weir had come to realize that he would have to move beyond the traditional and academic mode. And the Impressionism that he had first spurned in France asserted itself. Little by little, rougher brushwork, less attention to traditional perspective, the blurring of detail and emphasis on moods conveyed through color and shadow crept into his canvases.</p>
        <p>By the time of his first one-man show in 1891 in New York, the critics were calling Weir an Impressionist -- often derisively. He now openly admired Manet for one, though Weir's American brand of Impressionism was more muted in color and form than the French. His older brother, John F. Weir, a traditional painter who became the first dean of the Yale School of Art, was shocked.</p>
        <p>Weir, however, had been converted. And before he died, in 1919 at the age of 67, Weir had become a force in opening other artists' eyes to the new dawn. He was eulogized as one of the best-loved and influential American artists.</p>
        <p>A Weir scholar and a former curator at the William Benton Art Museum in Storrs, Hildegard Cummings, said that ''What makes Weir so significant for art lovers, particularly Americans is that his work not only represents Impressionism as carried here from France. His quiet canvases grasp a more lasting impression or essence of a landscape -- not the immediate feeling of the French school.'' Moreover, she said, Weir's output is infused with early 19th-century American values of ''simple family, home and work that he saw slipping away at the turn of the century.''</p>
        <p>The executive director of the Weir Farm Trust, Constance Evans, added that ''the reason artists and the general public keep coming here is because they are attracted by a landscape that is intimate and serene -- as opposed to wild and awe-inspiring.''</p>
        <p>About the painting that started it all -- the one that Weir traded for his farm -- little is known, except that it was a still life by an artist named Procter. Its fate has been swallowed in the mists of art history, its whereabouts unknown.</p>
