        <p>Fred Tomaselli  Jack Tilton Gallery 49 Greene Street SoHo Through June 17</p>
        <p>Say no to drugs. But don't say no to Fred Tomaselli's paintings, which include large quantities of drugs: chemical and botanical, prescription and over-the-counter, legal and illegal. Mr. Tomaselli arranges pills, stems and leaves into decorative patterns, sometimes free-standing and sometimes superimposed on painted patterns or landscapes. The whole thing is then embedded in a thick layer of transparent resin, which from a distance makes the work look strangely like huge, glossy illustrations from a textbook or magazine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tomaselli has been working in this vein for several years, and his compositions seem to be getting simultaneously bolder and more subtle. The pills have spread out into patterns recalling constellations or molecular bonds, while his Sierra Club landscapes have been reduced to the black trees silhouetted against a twilight sky. Odds and ends from the past appear with hallucinatory clarity: leaves and stems arranged like a real-life botanical print, or surrounded by blue and red flames recalling psychedelic album covers of the 1960's. The subject is narcotics, but the effect is exquisitely controlled. PEPE KARMEL</p>
