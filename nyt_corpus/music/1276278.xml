        <p>The Dallas Cowboys, putting an end to an era of extraordinary success, waived Troy Aikman yesterday, convinced that the concussion-plagued 34-year-old quarterback, who led the team to three Super Bowl titles, could no longer remain healthy enough to be their starter.</p>

        <p>The Dallas Cowboys, putting an end to an era of extraordinary success, waived Troy Aikman yesterday, convinced that the concussion-plagued 34-year-old quarterback, who led the team to three Super Bowl titles, could no longer remain healthy enough to be their starter.</p>
        <p>Aikman, who has suffered 10 concussions in his 12-year career, sounded yesterday like a man not prepared to retire.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to play somewhere,'' Aikman said. ''Whether that's able to work out or not, I don't know. There's nothing definitive.''</p>
        <p>Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said in a telephone interview from California that Aikman would take time to review his options. Aikman said it was ''a mutual and amicable decision'' to waive him.</p>
        <p>Steinberg said he and the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, had been talking for several weeks about Aikman's future and ''there was general recognition that the Aikman era was over and that if a decision was delayed it would not afford Troy the chance to at least explore what his other options were.''</p>
        <p>The Cowboys, who do not have a first-round draft pick, had to waive Aikman by yesterday or pay him a $7 million bonus and extend his contract through 2007. Aikman will still count for $10 million against the $67.4 million salary cap next season, and that will force the Cowboys to slash players from the roster to get under the cap.</p>
        <p>''In the end it was in the best interest for him to have a timely opportunity to entertain all of his options,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys are left with only Anthony Wright, who started and lost two games last season, and Clint Stoerner, who was 3 of 5 in one game last year, remaining on their roster at quarterback.</p>
        <p>Tony Banks, who lost the starting job in Baltimore last season, has visited the Cowboys. Dallas may also be interested in Trent Dilfer, who wrested the job from Banks and led the Ravens to a Super Bowl title. But the Cowboys may not be able to afford any veterans and may have to pick up a quarterback through the draft.</p>
        <p>''As far as what's in the best interest of this club long term, the right thing was done,'' Aikman said.</p>
        <p>His final play as a Cowboy ended in a concussion when he was thrown to the ground by Washington linebacker LaVar Arrington in the first quarter of a victory over the Redskins on Dec. 10.</p>
        <p>Aikman is known for his powerful accuracy. He was the first overall pick in the 1989 draft and the first selection of the Jones-Jimmy Johnson regime. But he has suffered four concussions in his last 20 starts. He holds nearly every Dallas passing record and has completed 2,898 passes of 4,715 attempts for 32,942 yards and 165 touchdowns. But he is coming off the worst season since the Cowboys went 1-15 when Aikman was a rookie.</p>
        <p>He had the lowest quarterback rating in the National Football Conference for a starting quarterback and, more ominously, he missed five games with injuries -- including two concussions in just 11 games -- and was knocked out of three more games, all in the first quarter. He twice needed epidural injections to relieve back pain. He threw a career-worst five interceptions against the Giants last October.</p>
        <p>For months there has been speculation that Aikman would retire because of his frightening susceptibility to head injury, which ended the career of San Francisco quarterback Steve Young last off-season and which has also cast doubt on the future of the hockey superstar Eric Lindros. But before last season, a magnetic resonance imaging indicated that Aikman had suffered no lingering damage from the concussions.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how Aikman's history of injury will affect his opportunities with other teams, although one National Football League official whose team is not in need of a quarterback said he would expect teams to be cautious about Aikman.</p>
        <p>''I'd be real nervous, with what he's gone through,'' the official said. ''I think he can still play, but he's getting up there and the 11th one comes easier than the second. But teams are so desperate for quarterbacks, somebody will pick him up.''</p>
        <p>Steinberg has been outspoken in the past about his concerns for players with concussions, and it would not be a surprise if he advised Aikman to retire. Last year, Young took the entire off-season before he decided to walk away.</p>
        <p>Aikman could do the same. But if he chooses to play, perhaps the most likely landing spot is San Diego, where Aikman's friend and former offensive coordinator Norv Turner is the offensive coordinator for the Chargers.</p>
        <p>The Chargers have had talks with Doug Flutie this week and are expected to draft Michael Vick as the No. 1 pick over all. Aikman could be brought in for the short term to groom Vick. Steinberg called San Diego yesterday afternoon to alert the Chargers that Aikman would be on the waiver wire.</p>
        <p>Aikman was one-third of a brilliant triumvirate with wide receiver Michael Irvin and running back Emmitt Smith that propelled the Cowboys from the league's cellar to three Super Bowl titles in four years in the 1990's, including consecutive championships in 1992 and 1993. Irvin retired last year because of a spinal condition, leaving only Smith from the glory days.</p>
