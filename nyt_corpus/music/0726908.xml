        <p>Maybe it's the season, but Rutland Boughton's "Immortal Hour" seems to resemble nothing so much as a spectacular balloon for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade that sprang an irreparable leak after its wildly acclaimed early appearances. Lord knows, plenty of hot air is available.</p>

        <p>An 'Immortal' Hour Shows Signs of Mortality  Juilliard Theater</p>
        <p>Maybe it's the season, but Rutland Boughton's "Immortal Hour" seems to resemble nothing so much as a spectacular balloon for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade that sprang an irreparable leak after its wildly acclaimed early appearances. Lord knows, plenty of hot air is available.</p>
        <p>First performed in 1914, Boughton's opera held the stage in London for 216 consecutive performances beginning in 1922 and triumphed in revivals over the next decade. But later attempts to re-inflate it have proved largely futile.</p>
        <p>Frank Corsaro staged it for the Bel Canto Opera in 1985, and has now elaborated that production at the Juilliard Opera Center. His affection for the work is apparent in the utter seriousness of his approach to this gloss on Celtic mythology, in which an earthly king, Eochaidh, finds his immortal hour in a relationship with a fairy, Etain, only to have her abandon him for her former lover, Midir, prince of the immortals. Eochaidh dies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corsaro tries heroically to involve the audience in this static tale by stationing performers around the auditorium or moving them through it. And the young performers turned in fine efforts at the opening, on Wednesday evening: Peggy Kriha (Etain), Brian Nickel (Eochaidh), Jon Villars (Midir), Jamie Offenbach (Dalua, an outcast and catalyst) and a good orchestra and excellent chorus, conducted by Randall Behr.</p>
        <p>But none of it can patch over the ultimate weakness of Boughton's score, which alternates between maundering abstraction and jaunty folkishness. JAMES R. OESTREICH  IN PERFORMANCE</p>
