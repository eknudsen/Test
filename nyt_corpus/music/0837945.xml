        <p>The Ozone Disco Pub in suburban Manila, the site of a fire that killed at least 150 people, had been approved for occupancy by no more than 35 people, officials said today. About 400 people were packed inside when the blaze started.</p>
        <p>Officials also said the emergency exit was blocked by a new building next door.</p>
        <p>Obviously, the fire exits were not inspected," said Ismael Mathay, the Mayor of Quezon City, the suburb where the Ozone is located. "This was undoubtedly a deathtrap."</p>
        <p>It was the end of the school year in the Philippines, the season for graduation parties. At least 350 customers and a staff of 40 were inside, and many were dancing to pop music played by a disk jockey. The fire began shortly after midnight today, and the dance crowd began a stampede toward the only door. Many of the people inside were unable to get out before the flames spread.</p>
        <p>Authorities and family members tried today to identify the badly burned bodies from bits of jewelry and shoes.</p>
        <p>President Fidel Ramos, touring the ruins of the popular nightclub, demanded that the discotheque's owners be questioned about why they had let in so many people. If the four owners fail to show up for questioning, he said, they should be arrested.</p>
        <p>Safety officials said the club had been approved for occupancy by 35 people.  They also said club and restaurant owners often found it cheaper to bribe officials than to honor building regulations.</p>
        <p>Hermilo Ocampo, one of the owners, said the disco had a safety certificate from the Bureau of Fire Protection. The high toll, he said, was caused by the panic triggered by the heavy smoke, which made it difficult for people to find the exit.</p>
        <p>The Ozone was a place where upper-middle-class Manila youths went to be seen. There was food, drink and a tiny dance floor wedged between the disk jockey's station and the bar.</p>
        <p>It was just after midnight, and the dancing and drinking were in full swing when sparks flew from the disk jockey's booth, witnesses said.  Next came the smoke. Everything went dark and terrified customers scrambled for the exit.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, flames were moving through the nightclub, fueled by acoustic  foam insulation. The lights were falling from the ceiling, the mezzanine had collapsed and the corridor to the only exit was waist-deep in bodies charred beyond recognition.</p>
        <p>Some of the bodies were so badly burned that firemen, working with their bare hands, had to take care not to tear them apart when they handled them.</p>
        <p>Only 16 of the victims have been identified so far, and many of those matches were made on the basis of what they wore or carried. Outside, officials displayed piles of shoes, makeup kits, wallets and jewelry.</p>
        <p>Filipinos were stunned by the tragedy, which follows a string of natural and  man-made disasters, including a typhoon last November that killed 800 people and a ferry sinking in February in which at least 50 people died.</p>
        <p>Officials said the fire was the deadliest in the history of the Philippines.  It was the world's deadliest nightclub fire since 1977, when a fire in a Southgate, Ky., club killed 164 people.</p>
        <p>In addition to the dead, dozens of people suffered third-degree burns, and crowded hospitals in Quezon City were forced to send many victims to more distant facilities.</p>
        <p>Gerald Loyola, 27, lay in the East Avenue Medical Center, trying not to move  because of the pain. Most of his hair is gone, and his face and arms are severely burned. A waiter at the nightclub, he was his family's main breadwinner, with his salary of $5.50 a day.</p>
        <p>He said he watched as the fire moved across the discotheque's ceiling, with the flames jumping onto people as they passed. "Amid the pandemonium, I tried to keep cool," he said. "But when I saw myself catch fire, I also panicked and started running toward the exit."</p>
        <p>With flames still licking over his clothes, Mr. Loyola squeezed into the crowded corridor and was eventually pushed outside in a stampede. He said he was among the last to get out alive. "Who will feed my family now?" he moaned.</p>
