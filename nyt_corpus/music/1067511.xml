        <p>It was nice to see Peter Keepnews give credit to the bandleaders who brighten up the talk show circuit with witty musical choices. Mr. Keepnews, though, wrote that the idea of picking relevant song titles ''seems to have originated'' with Paul Shaffer ''back in the early days of Mr. Letterman's late-night show.''</p>

        <p>It was nice to see Peter Keepnews give credit to the bandleaders who brighten up the talk show circuit with witty musical choices. Mr. Keepnews, though, wrote that the idea of picking relevant song titles ''seems to have originated'' with Paul Shaffer ''back in the early days of Mr. Letterman's late-night show.''</p>
        <p>Surely Mr. Keepnews is familiar with the band fronted by the drummer Bobby Rosengarden for the ''Dick Cavett Show'' in the early 1970's. As a teen-aged saxophone player at the time, I paid close attention any time the band played. Rosengarden was more subtle, and humorous, in his choices than much of what you hear on today's talk shows.</p>
        <p>My favorite was the entrance for a sex-therapist guest. The band played Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke's ''I Can't Get Started.''</p>
