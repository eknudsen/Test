        <p>JEFF FOLMSBEE seems calmer now. ''Do You Wanna Dance?'' is playing, and Boyd Gaines is onstage in the empty Vivian Beaumont Theater, wooing Deborah Yates, better known as the Girl in the Yellow Dress (but at the moment wearing a fleece top and pants). A crew of five is filming the couple's every move as they run through a scene from Susan Stroman's dance play ''Contact.'' The crew has already shot Ms. Stroman leading a rehearsal of dancers and a rehearsal of the show's 18th-century girl-in-a-swing scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Folmsbee, who is carrying a collection of a dozen or so scribbled-on Playbills, was pacing earlier in the day. At this point in early May, the Tony Awards are less than five weeks away but the nominations have yet to be announced, so he and his team are running around town madly filming shows they are guessing will be nominated. This film will go into the documentary segments that dot the first hour of the Tony Awards telecast (tonight at 8). You know, the hour that's on PBS before the CBS show begins.</p>

        <p>JEFF FOLMSBEE seems calmer now. ''Do You Wanna Dance?'' is playing, and Boyd Gaines is onstage in the empty Vivian Beaumont Theater, wooing Deborah Yates, better known as the Girl in the Yellow Dress (but at the moment wearing a fleece top and pants). A crew of five is filming the couple's every move as they run through a scene from Susan Stroman's dance play ''Contact.'' The crew has already shot Ms. Stroman leading a rehearsal of dancers and a rehearsal of the show's 18th-century girl-in-a-swing scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Folmsbee, who is carrying a collection of a dozen or so scribbled-on Playbills, was pacing earlier in the day. At this point in early May, the Tony Awards are less than five weeks away but the nominations have yet to be announced, so he and his team are running around town madly filming shows they are guessing will be nominated. This film will go into the documentary segments that dot the first hour of the Tony Awards telecast (tonight at 8). You know, the hour that's on PBS before the CBS show begins.</p>
        <p>''Some people may think of us as the preshow, but we're not,'' says Mr. Folmsbee, the hour's co-executive producer, understandably offended by the notion. This year, he hopes, that point is being made more forcefully than before. The title of the hour is ''The First 10 Awards: Tonys 2000'' (last year it was ''Broadway '99: Launching the Tonys,'' which the producers concede may have contributed to the misconception). The first-hour show is getting equal space with the CBS show on the official posters. Rosie O'Donnell -- who is returning as host of the overall telecast -- will be acting as live host of the first hour, with Nathan Lane as co-host.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane put in a plug for the PBS hour on Ms. O'Donnell's daytime talk show last Tuesday (a good thing, since the show has been promoting the awards as ''this Sunday on CBS at 9 p.m.''). ''It's like the early part of the party,'' he said, urging viewers to tune in. Ms. O'Donnell chimed in, ''It's like the cocktail party -- with awards.'' Ms. O'Donnell and Mr. Lane will open the show with a glitzy number to the tune of Stephen Sondheim's ''Comedy Tonight.''</p>
        <p>''It will reinforce what is true,'' says Mr. Folmsbee. ''This is a three-hour ceremony on two networks.''</p>
        <p>When that three-hour broadcast begins, Mr. Folmsbee and the documentary segments' producer, Mark Mannucci, will be in black tie but packed with other workers inside a control room on wheels, a huge tractor-trailer truck parked near Radio City Music Hall. It's a CBS truck.</p>
        <p>This strange dual-network arrangement began in 1997 after the League of American Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing, which present the Tonys, approached WNET (Channel 13), New York's public broadcasting station. CBS -- troubled, like other networks, by the growing and unpredictable length of awards telecasts -- had decided it could no longer commit to more than a two-hour show.</p>
        <p>The people at WNET said yes. ''I had some compassion for this,'' says Jac Venza, the station's director of culture and arts programs and the show's other co-executive producer. In the past, he says, when classical music shows he produced received awards, the category was relegated to the off-air presentations.</p>
        <p>He does not consider the first hour of the Tonys a poor relation to the CBS portion of the show, but he sees that attitude as par for the course. ''Everything we've started was once thought of as something the networks didn't want,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Lots of the hour's loyal viewers consider the first hour superior to the rest of the telecast. ''Oh, I love the 8 o'clock show,'' says David F. Richardson, a theater critic for WOR Radio. ''PBS always does a fantastic job. It's one of the best parts.''</p>
        <p>Bob Burrichter, a movie-theater marketing manager, feels the same way. ''Wouldn't miss it,'' says Mr. Burrichter, a onetime theater publicist. ''I just think it brings a whole different dimension to watching the Tonys on TV. It gives the designers and the other people behind the scenes their just due, and it nurtures interest in the theater on the creative side, not just commercial.''</p>
        <p>Creatively, the show has been well received too. Mr. Mannucci, who this year is producing five three-minute to nine-minute documentary segments (on the musical season and on the nominated scenic designers, lighting designers, costume designers and directors), sees the segments as ''the heart of the hour.''</p>
        <p>''You get to root for the people you saw,'' says Mr. Mannucci. ''The stories are told from a human angle.'' And there are the same humans from the short films, sitting in the audience in evening wear, chewing on their cuticles, accidentally applauding their own nominations, preparing to look brave.</p>
        <p>The PBS hour has its critics as well. Last year, while CBS was being lambasted for cutting a musical number from ''It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' but keeping a deadly dramatic reading from the nominated plays, WNET was being criticized for its treatment of Uta Hagen. Ms. Hagen, who played Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello and won Tonys for originating the lead female roles in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and ''The Country Girl,'' was honored with a lifetime achievement award. But she wasn't even asked to go onstage. On the Oscars, a career like this would be occasion for five minutes of film clips and a standing ovation. On the Tonys, Ms. Hagen stood at her seat and waved. ''We got letters,'' Mr. Folmsbee admits.</p>
        <p>With or without gaffes, for people who love theater, the show's first hour has a glamour all its own. Last year the first presenters were Alan Cumming (wearing a red shirt, a long black jacket and what appeared to be a fishing hat), who had won for ''Cabaret'' the year before, and Audra McDonald, who has won for ''Carousel,'' ''Master Class'' and ''Ragtime.'' The documentary segments included Kevin Spacey, on the stage set of ''The Iceman Cometh,'' commenting on the experience of being directed (''Sometimes you just say, 'Just tell me how you want me to say it' ''), Kristin Chenoweth rehearsing her star-making performance as Sally in ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' and Harold Prince reflecting on why there will always be theater. Tonight's segments will include this season's toasts of Broadway, like Heather Headley of ''Aida,'' Stephen Dillane and Jennifer Ehle of ''The Real Thing,'' and Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly of ''True West.''</p>
        <p>The hour's awards aren't just important; sometimes they're historic. In 1998, after some 50 years of men having received the best director Tonys, women were named best directors of a play (Garry Hynes for ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and of a musical (Julie Taymor for ''The Lion King''). Both Ms. Hynes and Ms. Taymor received their awards and made their speeches during the PBS show.</p>
        <p>Which, come to think of it, always ends promptly at 9 p.m. How do they do it, while the commercial networks let Oscar and Emmy and Grammy telecasts ramble on into Letterman-Leno territory?</p>
        <p>''We have different versions of the segments -- long, short and medium,'' says Mr. Mannucci. ''I don't want to tempt fate,''</p>
