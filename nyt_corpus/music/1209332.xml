        <p>CAN you just stay focused, sweetheart?'' Jonathan Greenfield says tersely to his wife as they settle into a hotel lobby in Danbury, Conn., near their home. ''It's so important for you to listen to the question and not just open your guts.'' He apologizes for his wife, whom he manages professionally. ''We always have this discussion!''</p>
        <p>Ronnie Spector Greenfield is nervous and certainly scattered, but if her thoughts, rendered in a froggy smoker's voice, scamper off in exultation, why not?</p>
        <p>After all, a 13-year-old lawsuit over royalties from songs she recorded when she was clambering out of her teens has just been resolved in her favor.</p>
        <p>It turns out that for such ringing, glorious 60's hits like ''Be My Baby,'' ''Baby I Love You'' and ''Walking in the Rain,'' Ronnie and the Ronettes, the shimmying bad girls once so famous that their opening act was the Rolling Stones,  received only a one-time check of $14,482.30 from Phil Spector, Mrs. Greenfield's former husband. Last week, a New York State Supreme Court justice  ruled that Mr. Spector, who repackaged the Ronettes' songs for oldies collections, commercials and movies like ''Dirty Dancing,'' owed Mrs. Greenfield and the Ronettes -- her sister and cousin -- $2.6 million.</p>
        <p>''I'm amazed it's over,'' says Mrs. Greenfield, 56, who still wears her luxuriant dark hair long, as she did as a teenager, her eyes made up with liquid black liner, her much-imitated look. Even now, a mother of two teenagers, she has an irrepressible girlish eagerness that is endearing and, despite her flinty ambition, vulnerable. ''I can have my career back!''</p>
        <p>Getting her career back has pretty much been her goal since that morning in 1972 when Ronnie Spector finally got her husband's permission to take a sunlit stroll. She walked out of the gloomy, guarded Beverly Hills mansion barefoot so as not to arouse his suspicions and just kept going. Mr. Spector later paid her divorce lawyers in nickels and stamped her alimony checks with an expletive.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Greenfield wrote in her 1990 autobiography, ''Be My Baby'' (with a foreword by Cher, another comeback queen who knows from Svengalis), the brilliant Mr. Spector adored her voice and what she calls  her ''Spanish Harlem half-breedishness.'' Her mother, a hard-working waitress, was black and American Indian, her father, a happy-go-lucky drinker and unemployed drummer, was white.</p>
        <p>IT all crested when the Fabulous Ronettes were touring England and ''Be My Baby'' was a worldwide hit. She was 20.</p>
        <p>''This is what I was waiting for all my life,'' she says with a throaty laugh. ''I was in love with the man I adored and he even flew over to England to see me. And Phil hates to fly.</p>
        <p>''And there was my audience! The applause! We had girls who wanted to wear their hair like us, in beehives, the Chinese bangs, the long braid! The kids would be screaming and tearing your clothes off! I loved it! 'Want my shirt? Here! Want a shoe? Here!' ''</p>
        <p>In 1968, after the Ronettes dissolved, the couple married. She has often described her reclusive, gilded life. His gift of a Camaro came with a mannequin in the passenger seat wearing Mr. Spector's trademark cap, so it would always look as if he was accompanying her. Opera, which she hates, resounded through their home. He repeatedly made her sit through screenings of ''Citizen Kane.''</p>
        <p>''That girl couldn't sing,'' Mrs. Greenfield says, hurt shadowing her face. ''Was Phil trying to tell me something?''</p>
        <p>Bored, isolated: ''I'd get drunk so I could go to rehab, just to get out of the house.'' She adds brightly, ''I got to hear Carole King's 'Tapestry' in rehab!''</p>
        <p>After she left Mr. Spector, she asked the impresario Murray the K for work. ''I'm only 29 but I'm an oldie but goodie? I just poured vodka into my soda.''</p>
        <p>Yet she was plucky and blessed with a much-admired sin-'n'-innocence tremolo. Billy Joel wrote ''Say Goodbye to Hollywood'' for her. She toured with oldies shows and Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Last fall she released a five-song collection, ''She Talks to Rainbows,'' whose co-producer was Joey Ramone. She kept bobbing back up, even performing for President Clinton (who greeted her, arms wide, singing, ''Be my little baby!'').</p>
        <p>In 1980, at 36, she met Mr. Greenfield, 15 years her junior, who had seen her show when he was a smoldering, smitten teenager. ''He didn't pull on me right away like most guys,'' Mrs. Greenfield says. ''So we were friends first. If I thought a date was trying to kiss me before we went out to dinner, I'd call up Jonathan and say, 'I need you to fix something!' And he would get rid of the guy for me.''</p>
        <p>When she credits Mr. Greenfield for the lawsuit, he erupts, excoriating her low self-esteem, but ending with a pep talk. ''You were the trailblazer 35 years ago and after you filed the lawsuit, you wouldn't go away! That's what the Bad Girl is about!''</p>
        <p>Ronnie, how have you changed?</p>
        <p>''I'm my own person,'' she replies. ''I was so controlled by Phil and now I have my own ideas. With this lawsuit over, I'm only looking forward: to my future, to singing rock 'n' roll.''</p>
        <p>''That's beautiful, sweetheart,'' her husband says.</p>
        <p>Last month, along with singers like Mary Chapin Carpenter and Sheryl Crow, Mrs. Greenfield appeared at a House subcommittee hearing on a new copyright law. When she was introduced, she broke into ''Wuh-uh-uh-oh, be my, be my baby,'' startling her buttoned-up audience. ''I just felt the urge,'' she explains. Afterward, she was swarmed by autograph seekers. ''I saw Mary Bono and said: 'Hi! How are the kids?' ''</p>
