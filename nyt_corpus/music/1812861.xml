        <p>D J Clue  ''The Professional 3''  (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam)</p>
        <p>For years D J Clue was one of the leading mixtape D.J.'s in New York; on Canal Street, on 125th Street, on Fulton Street Mall, his name on the cover was a good reason to part with $5. His reputation had more to do with connections than turntable skill: he got good songs and exclusives, and he got them early. But the mixtape world is a ruthless place; as D J Clue went mainstream (he helped turn his protégé Fabolous into a hip-hop star, and he turned himself into an MTV personality), the mixtape world moved on without him.</p>

        <p>D J Clue  ''The Professional 3''  (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam)</p>
        <p>For years D J Clue was one of the leading mixtape D.J.'s in New York; on Canal Street, on 125th Street, on Fulton Street Mall, his name on the cover was a good reason to part with $5. His reputation had more to do with connections than turntable skill: he got good songs and exclusives, and he got them early. But the mixtape world is a ruthless place; as D J Clue went mainstream (he helped turn his protégé Fabolous into a hip-hop star, and he turned himself into an MTV personality), the mixtape world moved on without him.</p>
        <p>Now he's back with ''The Professional 3,'' his fourth major-label album and his first in five years. And it's pretty good: full of verses from scowling New Yorkers and their out-of-town counterparts. The Harlem rapper Cam'ron shows up to scramble some syllables: ''We whippin' whenever/Whips? We whip 'em though weather/Snow, rain, sleet -- get it together.'' And when Juelz Santana collides with Young Jeezy, one result is a high-spirited (and mainly unprintable) three minutes of trash talk.</p>
        <p>There's something gently nostalgic about this disc, which celebrates a (slightly) earlier era in hip-hop. The Game and Mario Winans collaborate on a two-part song, ''A Week Ago,'' which takes its inspiration from a 1998 Jay-Z album track of the same name. And in a lighthearted track called, ''Like This,'' Fabolous and Kanye West trade lines, clearly enjoying the one-upmanship. ''My flow got teethmarks in it, and I know who the biters is,'' Fabolous says, complaining about copycats. Mr. West adds a rhyming affirmation: ''Get your own style -- don't Winona-Ryder his.'' At $13.98, this CD might not be a bargain, but at $5, it would be a steal.</p>
