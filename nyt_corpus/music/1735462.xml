        <p>THE C.M.A. awards -- ''Country Music's Biggest Night,'' as the ads branded it -- found Manhattan overrun by Nashville music-biz types for a week in November. And while platinum acts like Trace Adkins and Brad Paisley rehearsed for a special Grand Ole Opry broadcast just around the corner at Carnegie Hall, Jenny Lewis sat in a Greek restaurant chatting over beet salad. She was in town promoting her first solo record, titled ''Rabbit Fur Coat,'' a set of country-style story songs filled with gospel harmonies and verses about God. The timing, however, was purely coincidental.</p>
        <p>''I find most modern country virtually unlistenable,'' said Ms. Lewis, who will not be singing duets with Kenny Chesney anytime soon. ''I can't relate to the music or the lyrics. But I grew up on Loretta Lynn and Dusty Springfield. I remember lying about it; it wasn't cool to listen to country when I was 12. Ultimately, though, my voice, and the songs I did with Rilo Kiley, were revealing -- I had to fess up to being a country fan.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewis's day job remains lead singer for Rilo Kiley, the indie-rock band whose 2004 album ''More Adventurous'' topped many critics' best-of lists, as well as that of Elvis Costello, who said it showed ''the best lyric writing I've heard in many a day.''</p>
        <p>The recording, which sold more than 100,000 copies, was a breakthrough. First, it showed Ms. Lewis coming of age as a writer; she wrote about half its songs, the most memorable ones -- the Southern soul doppelg√§nger ''I Never'' and the adultery narrative ''Does He Love You?'' -- predicting the direction of her solo debut. It also aligned the band with a major label, Warner Brothers, and helped spur a string of arena dates opening for the megaband Coldplay.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Lewis has released ''Rabbit Fur Coat'' on the Team Love label, run by her friend Conor Oberst, the singer/songwriter who performs as Bright Eyes. ''One of the only reasons I made this record when I did was because, a couple of years ago, Conor asked me to,'' she said. ''At the time it didn't make sense, but I was honoring that moment, and Team's support of artists in general. I didn't know I could do it until he asked me; that's the funny thing. When someone you really admire puts faith in you, and ultimately dollar bills, it counts for a lot.''</p>
        <p>A petite woman with understated features and a spectacular mane of red hair, Ms. Lewis, 30, is one of indie rock's strongest female personalities -- she is often referred to as the scene's ''queen,'' or at least ''princess,'' and she walks like she talks it. She wears oversized sunglasses, but with an attitude of irony, and mentions a thrift store in Detroit as the source of a striking purple knit dress she's wearing (''I got three, in different colors''). Exuding a blend of self-possession and self-effacement, she alternates snappy retorts with worried confessions as if acting the role of the skeptical indie artiste. Which makes sense: the singer's performing career began as a child actress in Los Angeles, where she did everything from a Jell-O commercial to decidedly sub-classic movies like ''Troop Beverly Hills'' and ''Big Girls Don't Cry ... They Get Even.''</p>
        <p>She doesn't regard that career as training for this one. ''I was an actress, not a writer -- and not a very good actress,'' she said. ''This has more to do with Bobbie Gentry.'' But she still likes to act. The photos in the CD booklet could be stills from an early Robert Altman film: Ms. Lewis, wearing a scarlet dress, haunts a budget hotel with a young child and a pair of adult twins in matching turquoise blouses and eye shadow. The photographs suggest a meta-narrative for lyrics involving familiar Los Angeles themes like adultery, cocaine use, cosmetic surgery and house arrest.</p>
        <p>While the child in the photos is not Ms. Lewis's, the women are the Watson Twins, Leigh and Chandra, her musical collaborators on ''Rabbit Fur Coat'' (the group performs next Sunday at the Angel Orensanz Center in Manhattan). For all the Southern influences on her record, Ms. Lewis's main inspiration was more Northern: Laura Nyro and Labelle's 1971 collection of Brill Building and Motown classics ''Gonna Take a Miracle.'' Ms. Lewis thought the Watsons -- whom she met in Los Angeles through her band mate and ex-boyfriend Blake Sennett -- would be perfect at that style of gospel-flavored backing vocals; they agreed.</p>
        <p>The Twins, who will release their debut this month (''Southern Manners''), hail from Louisville, Ky., where they grew up singing in church choirs and admiring R &amp; B singers like Candi Staton. They say they especially like Ms. Lewis's lyrics, which invoke God and the Devil, often in surprising ways. The old-time gospel of ''Run Devil Run,'' and the new-age soul of ''Raise Up With Fists!'' suggest a familiar struggle to do right in a dirty world, while the wickedly jaunty ''The Charging Sky'' presents a disbelieving, free-associating narrator who prays ''as insurance'' and wonders ''What if God's not there?/ But his name is on your dollar bill/ Which just became cab fare.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewis, who is Jewish by birth (''although everyone assumes I'm a little shiksa,'' she says) and currently lives alone in Los Angeles, said the religious inquiries on ''Rabbit Fur Coat'' partly reflect her own spiritual musings. ''God he's a funny guy,'' she said. ''I'm not a religious person by any means. But I'm curious. And most of the time I feel really left out in the religious-slash-political climate of the country these days. Like, am I really missing out here? Everyone seems so completely faithful, and so happy about it.''</p>
        <p>Trying to imagine herself into the heads of religious believers (as kindred singers Steve Earle and Dar Williams have in recent songs) was also a way out of writing strictly about herself, although Ms. Lewis coyly suggests ''Rabbit Fur Coat'' is ''all autobiographical, in the end.'' That even extends to her remarkable cover of the Traveling Wilburys' ''Handle With Care,'' one of her ''all-time favorite songs.'' She gave the parts originally sung by Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison to her fellow indie-rock stars Ben Gibbard, M. Ward and Mr. Oberst (who, having long been billed as a ''new Dylan,'' gets to ape him here).</p>
        <p>The song is a marvelous mirror of a classic, right down to Mr. Gibbard's shimmering 12-string guitar work. But being a bona fide writer now, Ms. Lewis elected to alter the lyrics just slightly, replacing ''fobbed'' in Harrison's line ''I've been fobbed off'' with a more familiar expletive.</p>
        <p>''It's rough to take liberties with a song that's perfect,'' she said. ''But 'fobbed'? I tried, but I just couldn't sing it; it made me laugh every time.''</p>
