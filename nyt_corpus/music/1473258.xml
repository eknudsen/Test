        <p>HIGHLIGHTS</p>
        <p>THE GOAL IS OPERA -- After grand opera and soap opera, now comes the hockey opera. The Czech National Theater announced yesterday that it was preparing an opera to commemorate the gold medal won by the Czech Republic's men's hockey team at the 1998 Olympic games in Nagano, Japan. Jiri Nekvasil, artistic director of the theater's opera productions, told Reuters that the work, tentatively titled ''Nagano,'' was to open on April 8, 2004, at the theater in Prague where Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' had its premiere in 1787. The Czech team, led by Jaromir Jagr and Dominik Hasek and including more than a dozen National Hockey League stars, upset Canada and beat Russia to win the gold medal. Mr. Nekvasil said, ''It is a kind of modern Czech legend, and operas have always been based on legends.''</p>

        <p>HIGHLIGHTS</p>
        <p>THE GOAL IS OPERA -- After grand opera and soap opera, now comes the hockey opera. The Czech National Theater announced yesterday that it was preparing an opera to commemorate the gold medal won by the Czech Republic's men's hockey team at the 1998 Olympic games in Nagano, Japan. Jiri Nekvasil, artistic director of the theater's opera productions, told Reuters that the work, tentatively titled ''Nagano,'' was to open on April 8, 2004, at the theater in Prague where Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' had its premiere in 1787. The Czech team, led by Jaromir Jagr and Dominik Hasek and including more than a dozen National Hockey League stars, upset Canada and beat Russia to win the gold medal. Mr. Nekvasil said, ''It is a kind of modern Czech legend, and operas have always been based on legends.''</p>
        <p>DUTCH MASTERS ON DISPLAY -- Boasting names like Rembrandt and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, an exhibition of more than 100 17th-century Dutch and Flemish drawings is to open on Saturday at Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass. The art, derived from the Maida and George Abrams Collection, one of the leading assemblages of 17th-century Dutch drawings in private hands, features outstanding acquisitions of the past decade, including works by Hendrick Avercamp, Jan van Goyen, Joachim Wtewael and Cornelis van Haarlem. ''Bruegel to Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Drawings From the Maida and George Abrams Collection,'' on view through July 6, also includes rare watercolors.</p>
        <p>PIONEERS IN PHOTOGRAPHY -- Their names were Jessie Tarbox Beals (1870-1942), Antoinette Bryant Hervey (1857-1945) and Mattie Edwards Hewitt (circa 1870-1956). They were contemporaries. They were New Yorkers, they had families, and they were photographers who pioneered in interior design and architectural and urban photography in the early 20th century, when new publications like Vogue (1892), House Beautiful (1896), Town and Country (1901) and House &amp; Garden (1901) provided a market for their work. Beals specialized in the tearooms, artists' garrets, shops and courtyard gardens of Greenwich Village. Hewitt was drawn to the interiors of fashionable homes, hotels, clubs and shops. Hervey's works, like the one above, documented the architecture and construction of the edifice that fascinated her throughout her life: the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. ''Beals, Hervey, and Hewitt: Women Pioneers of Architecture and Design Photography'' opens today and runs through July 13 at the New-York Historical Society.  CURRAN EVENTS  This week it's Sean Curran here  and Sean Curran there. If the inventive choreographer, below, isn't exactly everywhere, his footwork will nonetheless be highly visible. To look to the New Victory Theater in Times Square on Friday is to find his Sean Curran Company opening an engagement through March 30. To look to the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven on Friday is to find his choreography in the Yale Rep's new production of ''The Taming of the Shrew.'' At the New Victory, the 90-minute show will present the world premiere of ''The Amadinda Dances'' on a program that also includes ''Quadra Box Redux,'' ''Abstract Concrete,'' ''Metal Garden'' and ''Folk Dance for the Future.'' In New Haven, Shakespeare's classic battle of the sexes, directed by Mark Lamos and continuing through April 12, will be highlighted by something old and something new. As in Shakespeare's time, the company will be all male, but the setting will be current Latino culture that mixes Puerto Rico, Havana and the East Village.</p>
        <p>CELEBRATING ROSTROPOVICH -- Although the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich won't officially turn 76 until March 27, the festivities planned by the New York Philharmonic start on Thursday and won't end until April 5. Throughout the Philharmonic Festival: Slava &amp; Friends, Mr. Rostropovich will conduct works by composers he has known, including Bernstein, Britten, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. The concerts will feature performances by Mr. Rostropovich's colleagues and protégés, like the pianists Martha Argerich, Yefim Bronfman and Evgeny Kissin, the violinist Maxim Vengerov, the violist Yuri Bashmet and the cellist Xavier Phillips. And of course Mr. Rostropovich will perform as a cellist, in chamber concerts. The festivities begin at 7:30 Thursday night in Avery Fisher Hall, where Mr. Rostropovich will lead the Philharmonic and Ms. Argerich in works by Bernstein, Prokofiev, Dutilleux and Lutoslawski.</p>
        <p>FOOTNOTES</p>
        <p>Singers and songwriters provide the story of nightlife. At the Cafe Carlyle, Jane Monheit opens an engagement from tonight through March 29, with a tribute to Harold Arlen through songs like ''That Old Black Magic,'' ''As Long as I Live'' and ''Over the Rainbow.'' At Feinstein's at the Regency, ''Singers and Songwriters'' is the title of a six-week series that begins tonight when Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. will be joined through March 29 by Jimmy Webb, who wrote their hit ''Up, Up and Away,'' as well as ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Wichita Lineman'' and ''Didn't We.'' Coming up from April 1 to April 12 are Patti Austin with Michel Legrand and Alan Bergman, and from April 15 through 26 Melissa Manchester and Paul Williams.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 19, 2003, Wednesday  A report in the Arts Briefing column yesterday about ''Slava &amp; Friends,'' a New York Philharmonic series celebrating Mstislav Rostropovich that begins tomorrow, included an outdated reference to the pianist Martha Argerich. Ms. Argerich has canceled her concerts in March. She will be replaced at the festival by Konstantin Lifschitz and Evgeny Kissin.</p>
