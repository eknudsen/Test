        <p>To see one of his sculptures leading a full life of its own in the open air was one of Henry Moore's greatest pleasures. Most often, he liked to plan that life himself, in its every detail. But when someone else seemed to him to have got it exactly right he would clap his hands and shout aloud.</p>
        <p>A sculpture garden of precisely the right sort opened to the public today in a 17-acre wooded space adjacent to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art here. The work primarily of an architect, Jacquelin T. Robertson, and a landscape architect, Daniel Urban Kiley, the new garden has been two years in the making.</p>
        <p>It is a garden to Moore's own taste. He did not, as a matter of fact, care much for sculpture parks. It was not in his nature to stand by and gape while a bunch of mismatched bronzes glared at one another across a large open space. He had learned from his wife - a great gardener in her day -that surprise, asymmetry and a certain confidentiality were essential in planning a garden. And when, back at home at Much Hadham, England, he and she played the garden against the sculptures, and vice versa, they were duetists of a high order.</p>
        <p>The sculpture garden came into being as a result of a unanimous effort by the Hall Family Foundations, the Nelson-Atkins Museum and Kansas City's Board of Parks and Recreations Commissioners. Three years ago, the Hall Family Foundations, whose wealth derives from the sale of Hallmark greeting cards, acquired a collection of some 60 Henry Moore sculptures from George Ablah, a businessman in Wichita, Kan., to place them on long-term loan to the Nelson-Atkins. Mr. Ablah had been collecting Moores for a number of years and went so far as to install some of them in his private airplane. When the question arose as to how the sculptures could best be shown and enjoyed by the public, there was rapid and universal assent to the idea that has now come to fruition.</p>
        <p>Extensive plantings of one kind and another were involved - among them 60 river birches, 80 crab apples, 79 male ginkgo trees, 102 American lindens, 108 Norway spruces, 920 rock cotoneasters, 10,016 Japanese yews and 4,130 square feet of Baltic ivy.</p>
        <p>Among the architectural finessing - much of it intentionally so subtle as to pass unnoticed - this visitor spotted the crab orchard limestone steps and paths and the terraces of diamond pink granite and sunset red granite. Bronze handrails - initialed N.A. in honor of the museum - are there to steady us, and in the center a formal mall reminds us that the garden is, after all, next-door neighbor to a grand old-fashioned museum building.</p>
        <p>But this is a sculpture garden, is it not? And one given over entirely to work that does a good job of domination when domination is called for? So where does the garden stop and the sculpture begin? ''Nowhere'' is the answer, because this is not a peremptory sculpture garden. It is a confidential sculpture garden, a place of secrets and seclusions where the duet of art and nature is perfectly in tune.</p>
        <p>We see the sculptures in ones and twos, but never in the same way twice over. The central mall drops 100 feet on its way down, but we never get a grand rhetorical overview of the kind that prevails at Versailles. Instead we wander as if in Shakespeare's forest of Arden, where magic and mystery hold court and romance takes us by the hand. It is never dull for a moment, and we can imagine Henry Moore humming and sniffing and conjecturing every inch of the way. Much that has been planted is still far short of maturity, but we are left in no doubt that in the year 1999 this will be a great place for meditation, tree-watching and the discreet plighting of troths.</p>
        <p>As always, works long familiar in other contexts look quite different in this one. The ''Large Interior Form'' of 1953 is a slender spiral, over 16 feet high, that can sometimes look almost too delicate to be allowed out on its own. But in Kansas City it is raised so high above us at the bottom of the garden that it seems to float free of all earthly concerns. So neatly is it sited, moreover, that the nearby traffic functions simply as a footnote that we don't have to read.</p>
        <p>Another piece that takes on a new identity is ''Reclining Connected Forms.'' This is a low-slung, almost ground-hugging piece, in which the forms in question seem to be raised, at most, on their elbows. (As to what they are doing, all options are open.) Reached by way of a narrow path lined by rubble walls that are roughly knee height, the sculpture turns out to be lying on a bed of ivy. Above it, an intimate amphitheater rises steeply. It is as if we had come upon a ritual of an unspecified kind - one that is incomplete without us and yet keeps its last secret intact.</p>
        <p>For two reasons, the ''Sheep Piece'' was familiar to every visitor to Moore's house in his later years. First, it was installed way off in the fields and visitors had to scramble their way toward it in varying degrees of excitement and awe. Second, real sheep were always on hand to rub themselves against the sheltering bronze in exactly the way that Moore intended. A unique patination resulted.</p>
        <p>In the Nelson-Atkins sculpture garden, the piece stands on high ground at a point chosen some years ago by Moore, who died in 1986. But we are encouraged to come upon it from still higher ground, thereby reversing the sensation. Of sheep, there is necessarily never a trace in this garden.</p>
        <p>To a remarkable extent, Mr. Robertson and Mr. Kiley make us forget that this garden is in the middle of a big city, with trafficked roads on three sides of it. Artful changes of scale, level and vegetation keep us continually alert. We know where we are and yet, over and over again, we wonder if some benign magic has not had its way with us. Nowhere is this more compelling than when two fiercely independent sculptures seem to stalk one another, with ourselves as witnesses who really ought not to be there. This happens to spectacular effect with the ''Large Torso: Arch'' and the ''Large Totem Head.''</p>
        <p>Demurrals are few. The ''Seated Woman'' at the bottom of the garden on the right as we walk downhill is one of Moore's more dumpy inventions and comes as something of a letdown. The trellised pavilions, of which much is expected in the 1990's, look both bare and gaunt at this moment. The ''Reclining Figure: Hand'' is so sited as to look like a giant gold tiepin on a green shirtfront. These things apart, the tour is blissful.</p>
