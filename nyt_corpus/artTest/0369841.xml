        <p>Lorna Simpson's Conceptual-based art, which is currently the subject of a ''Projects'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, has a double theme: the oppression of blacks and of women. Combining large-scale photographs with words engraved on small plastic plaques, Ms. Simpson fuses these themes into a unity that is sometimes provocative, sometimes too simple and stylish for its own good.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simpson is adept at linking words, to one another and to images, in quietly explosive ways. One side of a two-panel work called ''Outline'' focuses on a black-and-white photograph in which long strands of dark braided hair are arranged in a rectangle on a dark background and labeled with the word ''back,'' all with the cool precision of a museum display of artifacts. In the other panel we see, from the back, the shoulders and close-cropped head of a young dark-skinned woman wearing a low-cut black dress. This image is overlaid with words that complete ''back'' in a harsh, suggestive manner -''lash,'' ''bone,'' ''ground,'' ''ache'' and ''pay'' - conjuring prejudice, exploitation and even violence, but also inherent, inherited strength.</p>
        <p>The braids might come from the adjacent head, cut off in punishment or in the desire to move on, to grow up, to do battle. The figure suggests timeless resistance, a slave woman or a reverse mug shot, a slave auction or an interrogation, but it also has the sleek severity of an unusual fashion photograph. In the end we may wonder if we are simply reading ''blackness'' into both images.</p>
        <p>The dark images of hair and back recur in several other works, although never with the force or complexity of ''Outline.'' Too often Ms. Simpson suggests a large and important subject but treats it ambiguously and also without giving the viewer enough to look at. This is the case in an untitled work that uses three frontal images of a woman's body from the neck down, shot in color and clothed in a simple sleeveless white gown that again mixes institutional references: slavery, hospital, church. Transparent plastic plaques on the abdomen of each image spell out three verbs: ''prefer,'' ''refuse,'' ''decide.'' Abortion is the first thing that comes to mind here, but the idea soon expands to the simple issue of control, not just over one's body but over one's life in general, as a woman and as a person.</p>
        <p>In the end, it's a close call. In the recent past, Ms. Simpson has been more aggressive, as evidenced by such works as ''Guarded Conditions,'' which dominated her debut exhibition in SoHo last fall. Her new restraint is more personal, and there's something marvelous about the cool dignity with which she rises above the issues, not stooping to anger, not even letting us see her models' faces. But there is an opacity to these works that threatens to stifle their message. And while they ask more time and a more thoughtful response from the viewer, they don't always reward the attention.</p>
        <p>A parting complaint is that this is a rather skimpy show as ''Projects'' exhibitions go. More work would have given the public a better idea of what this promising young artist is up to.</p>
        <p>''Projects: Lorna Simpson'' remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, through Aug. 26.</p>
        <p>Teddy Shapiro Chris Wilder</p>
        <p>Petersburg</p>
        <p>130 Prince Street</p>
        <p>Through July 27</p>
        <p>This pair of one-person shows introduces two young painters whose efforts have little in common, but who complement each other well.</p>
        <p>Teddy Shapiro is something of a traditionalist whose tradition of choice seems to be the 1970's phenomenon of New Image painting -the wry schematic figuration of Neil Jenney, Nicholas Africano and Michael Hurson. His paintings feature several unrelated figures seen from radically different angles, against flatly painted monochromes of dark peach, light blue or green. His style of rendering is blunt and a trifle naive -almost of the storybook variety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro's figures and their rumpled clothes, like his slightly muted, mundane colors, evoke the 1940's or 50's - more the days of radio than of television. But his sense of a fluid yet fractured space in which everyone is separate is echoed by titles that imply complex, often psychological scenarios.</p>
        <p>In ''You Don't Know Me, You Don't,'' a distant woman, hands on hips, looks up from a light orange surface. Above her float three men, seen in different sizes from different viewpoints. The largest, a man in a sports jacket and a red tie, sits listlessly in an armchair as if contemplating some recent confrontation. In ''Make a Mask of Your Own Face, Wear It or Hang It Up,'' we might be interrupting an acting class. One man in gym clothes leans against a strip of deep red at the painting's edge, while another in street clothes flies through the air on the back of a chair. Meanwhile, a woman in red exits purposefully at left, as if set on taking a break elsewhere.</p>
        <p>One of the best things about these paintings is the thick swirling wet-on-wet way Mr. Shapiro paints the clothes of his subjects. It gives them weight and importance and a sense of inner turmoil that seems to be the central subject of his art.</p>
        <p>The appellation of painter applies much more loosely to Chris Wilder, an artist who seems to change styles and materials with each new artwork. The extraterrestrial encounter, or its simulation, is a recurring theme.</p>
        <p>One work titled ''U.F.O. Sighting at Monte Carlo'' is a color photocopy enlargement of a news photograph to which the artist has added an entirely appropriate purplish tint. We sense the imminence of an alien presence. Another work narrates the artist's attempt to do a public commission using a hologram projection too complex to be realized. This text appears on canvas, overpainted with sloshy abstraction - means that are decidedly more available. Three small abstractions in shiny tones of purple, orange and blue concern U.F.O. sightings, respectively, on the moon, in Death Valley and under water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder works with an appealing, if youthful, nonchalance, and seems equally at home with the physical and the conceptual. Unlike Mr. Shapiro's, his show is scattershot, to say the least, but the pieces work well together and their ensemble effect makes you wonder what's next.</p>
