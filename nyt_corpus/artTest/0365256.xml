        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>From Jailhouse to Art</p>
        <p>From Jailhouse to Art</p>
        <p>CREATIVITY is kept to a minimum when most of the photographs you take are mug shots. There is no special posing.</p>
        <p>''It's the standard, 'Turn this way and that,' '' said Charles W. Pawlik, a photographer for the Suffolk County Sheriff's office.</p>
        <p>There is no special lighting. ''We blow it out with two flashes,'' Mr. Pawlik said.  And the subjects usually have other things on their minds. ''You get the death stare from the murderers,'' he said. ''That look that says, 'There's nothing inside me.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pawlik, 28 years old, of Smithtown, works full time taking photos of criminals, crime scenes, battered bodies and police evidence.</p>
        <p>He spends his spare time taking black-and-white photos of delicate landscapes with a large 8-by-10-inch view camera. Each landscape is printed with a time-consuming palladium-based process. ''The palladium process gives a better gradation of tone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His landscapes are being exhibited at the Pasta Viola Restaurant in Stony Brook. Other than having victims look through mug-shot books, this is the first time his photographs have been on display. ''I normally wouldn't put them up in restaurant,'' he said. ''But they made a nice presentation of the prints.''</p>
        <p>People are noticing the photos, the chef, Leslie Sofarelli, said. ''We have a different type of restaurant here. Our customers acknowledge the ambience. They look at the walls.''</p>
        <p>''I actually do look at the walls,'' said a customer, Rita Redko, and the photos looked wonderful, she added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pawlik, who has worked at the jail for five years, said he would like to do fine art photography full time.</p>
        <p>''But the pay is good,'' he said. And the mug shots can be interesting. ''I liked the captain of the Valdez,'' he said. ''what was his name, Hazelwood? He was very respectable. He looked like the head of a big ship.''</p>
        <p>Was the skipper wearing a captain's cap? ''Hats are not allowed in jail,'' Mr. Pawlik said.</p>
        <p>New Church for Old Faith</p>
        <p>Dr. Nabil El-Deiry is Coptic. It's a religion, one of the oldest. ''It was established in 43,'' he said. As in 43 A.D. The Coptic Church, the Christian church of Egypt, will soon be the newest church of Woodbury.</p>
        <p>St. Araam, the first Coptic church on Long Island, is nearing completion on Woodbury Road. Drivers may have noticed its majestic gold dome and two beige towers.</p>
        <p>The church is a dream come true for Dr. El-Deiry of Port Jefferson. Since 1976 he has led the drive for the church. The 200 Coptic families on Long Island have been using a Ukrainian church in Hicksville for their weekly masses. ''It was very small,'' said Dr. El-Deiry, the vice president of the board of deacons.</p>
        <p>Throughout history Copts have faced enormous obstacles. The religion was founded by St. Mark, a Disciple of Jesus. Its followers were persecuted by the Persians, the Arabs and the Turks. It was not easy being Christian in a Moslem world, Dr. El-Deiry said.</p>
        <p>Long Island Copts have overcome their economic obstacle in building the church and eagerly await the church's opening. ''The Pope of Egypt came and blessed the ground in September,'' Dr. El-Deiry said.</p>
        <p>The Coptic Sunday masses last four hours. ''We do a lot of chanting,'' Dr. El-Deiry said.</p>
        <p>Animals Without Stuffing</p>
        <p>On a sunny Sunday, Bob and Donna Cummings were learning how to stuff a squirrel. The couple from Bay Shore had chosen a taxidermy class over a day on the water ''because it's too crowded out there,'' Mr. Cummings said. At ''Taxidermy: A Dying Art,'' crowds were definitely not a problem.</p>
        <p>Eight adults and four children went to the South Shore Nature Center in East Islip to watch a taxidermist demonstrate how to mount a squirrel. ''I thought it would be an interesting afternoon,'' said Gail Alexander of Bayport who took her two sons, Drew and Liam, and two friends.</p>
        <p>''I'm not interested in killing and stuffing something,'' Mrs. Cummings said. ''We're here more for curiosity. We always wondered how the stuffed animals in the Museum of Natural History got that way.''</p>
        <p>They soon learned. With tools lined up like a surgeon, the taxidermist, Richard Gibson of Brentwood, began. The good news was that the squirrel's ''meat'' had already been ''picked out,'' as Mr. Gibson put it. The squirrel on the table looked like a thin gray version of the furs that women wore in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>''My sister-in-law found this one dead,'' Mr. Gibson said. A taxidermist's family is always on the lookout, added his father, Richard C. Gibson. ''Our family is the ghoul patrol. We keep plastic bags in the trunks of our cars.''</p>
        <p>Taxidermy combines art and science, said Alison Tews of the nature center, which sponsored the class. The center, run by the Town of Islip, has 50 stuffed animals and birds on display.</p>
        <p>Technically, one does not stuff animals anymore, Mr. Gibson said. Taxidermists now use polyurethane forms.  ''In catalogues they sell any kind of animal form you want to mount,'' he said, holding up his squirrel form. The skin of the animal is put over the form. ''It's like sticking a hand into a glove,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The legs and feet are treated differently. Mr. Gibson used a caulking gun to fill the feet. He used clay for the legs.</p>
        <p>''I try to treat each mount as an individual,'' he said as he placed a wire in the tail of the squirrel. Using dental floss threaded through a surgeon's suture needle, Mr. Gibson sewed the squirrel together. ''I'm using the baseball stitch,'' he told the class. He mounted the animal on a piece of tree bark and fluffed the tail with a blow dryer. The squirrel was finished. ''He's bright eyed and bushy tailed,'' Mr. Gibson said.</p>
        <p>For Noncommercial Ads</p>
        <p>The amended-sign law in the Town of Islip could become required reading for classes in advanced marketing. The ordinance, effective this week, redefines the word ''advertising.''</p>
        <p>''You can put up a sign that says 'Macy's,' '' the deputy town attorney, Lawrence Donohue, said. ''But you can't put up a sign that says 'Macy's, the World's Largest Department Store.' '' That would be advertising, Mr. Donohue said, and commercial signs are not allowed to advertise.</p>
        <p>Political signs, however, can. In Islip, political signs are not considered advertisements. '' 'Vote for Frank Jones' is not advertising,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''It's a noncommercial message.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones and other politicians can put up their noncommercial messages as long as they put them over existing commercial signs. The law now bans temporary signs. No more placards on vacant lots. No more billboards. No more yard-sale signs. Well, maybe the town will look the other way on yard-sale signs, Mr. Donohue hinted.</p>
        <p>''The ordinance is quite simple,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''Explaining it is the difficult part.''</p>
