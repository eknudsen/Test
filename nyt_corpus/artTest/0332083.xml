        <p>LEAD: With daring and precision, two armed men in masks walked off one recent night with more than 200 valuable statuettes, vases and other objects that had been found in the remains here of the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum.</p>
        <p>With daring and precision, two armed men in masks walked off one recent night with more than 200 valuable statuettes, vases and other objects that had been found in the remains here of the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum.</p>
        <p>The theft, one of hundreds that occur in Italy every year, is believed by investigators to have been a hired job, possibly commissioned abroad. It has rekindled fears that the country's artistic heritage may be headed for a thorough sacking after December 1992, when trade barriers will fall and customs guards will all but disappear within the European Community.</p>
        <p>The more pessimistic among Italian experts worry that this conversion of Western Europe into a single economic body, with minimal checking of travelers' baggage at borders, will enable thieves to spirit away national treasures with near impunity.</p>
        <p>A Land With So Much to Steal</p>
        <p>Art theft seems to be increasing worldwide, and the pickings now are often easy in Italy, which is said by Unesco to possess more than half of the world's cultural holdings in its churches, public buildings, museums and private collections.</p>
        <p>According to statistics compiled by the Carabinieri, the national police force, 244,403 paintings, statues, frescoes, coins and other items were stolen in Italy from 1970 through 1989. Nearly half of those objects, 117,378, were recovered over the two decades, and 2,590 people were arrested.</p>
        <p>But a great deal obviously slipped away, and Col. Emidio Napolitano, who heads the Carabinieri's 80-member art-theft squad, warns that ''1992 will certainly make our job more difficult.'' Already, Colonel Napolitano says, he detects an increase in organized crime's involvement in such thefts.</p>
        <p>Seepage May Become Deluge</p>
        <p>Robberies aside, there is a basic division between art-exporting countries like Italy and art importers like Britain and West Germany, and many experts here fret that even the legal flow of artwork out of the country will turn into a flood after 1992. If cultural properties are to be treated no differently from other goods, then, theoretically, a Renaissance painting could be moved about as freely as other Italian products, from shoes to salami.</p>
        <p>Some art critics fear that the loss to researchers would be particularly keen. ''If art is bought like stocks by private investors, it will no longer be public property that can be available for expert study and public enjoyment,'' said Giulio Carlo Argan, an art critic and a former Mayor of Rome.</p>
        <p>Italy now tries to protect its patrimony through an often porous law, enacted in 1939, that requires Government approval before a piece of art can be exported; it applies to all works by artists who have been dead for at least 50 years.</p>
        <p>''No other country has such a tough law,'' Mr. Argan said. ''I also don't know of anyone who is in prison for violating it.'' Besides, he said, major provisions may no longer be valid in a unified European market.</p>
        <p>For instance, the statute requires art owners to register their possessions with the Government. That may work for well-known masterpieces or large collections, but knowledgeable Italians agree that only a minority of their countrymen obey the rule. And if a statue is not registered, they add, it may be considered not an acknowledged work of art but just another piece of merchandise, free to be circulated at will throughout an integrated European Community without risk of customs checks or other controls.</p>
        <p>New Standards Sought</p>
        <p>So Italian officials, art dealers, economists and others have begun to campaign for communitywide standards that would add new layers of protection for Italy and other art-rich countries of the Mediterranean like Greece, Spain and France.</p>
        <p>According to Stefano Rodota, an Italian member of Parliament involved in European Community negotiations, northern importing countries are generally more disposed to lax rules. Moreover, there are divisions even among Italians about how restrictive the standards should be.</p>
        <p>Art dealers, for example, are not interested in regulations that would appreciably limit their overseas business opportunities. There are also philosophical questions to be resolved. To cite one, why would it be legitimate to sell a 2,000-year-old Roman vase in Venice but not in Antwerp when Venice, although obviously part of Italy, had no more to do with ancient Rome than did the territory that now forms Belgium?</p>
        <p>Prof. Paolo Leon, an Italian economist who has studied the matter closely, argues for a ''territorial definition'' of art, in which an object found in, say, Syracuse, Sicily, should remain there.</p>
        <p>That may no longer be a practical idea, Professor Leon acknowledges. But he insists, at a minimum, on some sort of communitywide registry of paintings and statues to keep Europe's heritage in Europe. Otherwise, he says, items in the high-priced art world will flow inexorably to where the money is: the United States and, increasingly, Japan.</p>
        <p>A Late Beginning</p>
        <p>''Why should works of art go to Japan just because they are now economically ahead?'' he said. ''Then it will be Taiwan, then after that, some other place.''</p>
        <p>Italian experts agree that with 1992 just around the corner, they have begun their art-protection campaign somewhat late. They also acknowledge that they do not even know the extent of their patrimony, despite Unesco estimates that this country has 60 percent of the world's cultural properties.</p>
        <p>For the last 17 years, Prof. Oreste Ferrari has been compiling a registry of known art pieces for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Thus far, he and his assistants have catalogued 1.5 million pieces, and Professor Ferrari reckons that this may represent no more than 5 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>''But let's not have false illusions,'' he said. ''The catalogue is a necessary first step toward protecting our patrimony, but it is not a security system. Even catalogued items can be stolen.''</p>
        <p>And when it comes to guarding its own treasures, many experts condemn Italy's performance over the years. The theft on Feb. 2 at Ercolano, a few miles south of Naples, is a good example of the plundering that has gone on for decades.</p>
        <p>Late that night, the two armed men took six unarmed guards by surprise. Then they easily punched through a wall to get inside a storeroom that housed hundreds of objects found long ago inside the well-preserved ruins of ancient Herculaneum, which, like nearby Pompeii, died when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.</p>
        <p>Alarm Still Not Installed</p>
        <p>For four hours the thieves picked their way leisurely through priceless treasures, taking away a bronze vase in the shape of a woman's head, a small statue of the Roman god Bacchus, a gold snake's-head bracelet, along with earrings, coins, bracelets - 223 objects in all, a theft that the supervising architect, Tommasina Budetta, later called ''a disaster.''</p>
        <p>One suspect has been arrested, but the stolen objects have not been recovered. In the post-mortem, art experts complained that security at the site was lax, and they cited the fact that an alarm system, planned as far back as 1980, had yet to be installed. The reason: lack of Government financing, a recurring problem here.</p>
        <p>Although art and Italy are almost synonymous, the annual budget for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs is a shade under $1 billion, or roughly two-tenths of 1 percent of total Government spending. Cultural Affairs, which was created in 1974, also lacks strong advocates. Each of the last three ministers came from the Social Democratic Party, a junior partner in the five-party ruling coalition, and none possessed the obvious stature of European culture ministers like Jack Lang of France, Melina Mercouri of Greece or Jorge Semprun of Spain.</p>
        <p>Besides, some experts point out, Italy has long indulged in the luxury of lackadaisical behavior in part because it often could count on a new art treasure's turning up to take the place of one that had disappeared.</p>
        <p>It was no different with the Herculaneum robbery. Two weeks later, archeologists digging at Pompeii stumbled on a marble statue from the first century B.C., depicting a child on a dolphin. It stood a little more than a foot high and seemed to be in fine condition.</p>
