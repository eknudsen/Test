        <p>VISITORS to Davison Art Center, at Wesleyan University in Middletown, can see the pair of well-cut black riding boots -- or rather their silhouettes -- at 100 paces, hanging on the wall that faces the entrance of the gallery. The image is Jim Dine's and he produced it in 1965 at Universal Limited Art Editions, the print shop in West Islip, L.I., that was founded by Tanya Grosman in 1956 and first visited by Peter and Susan Ralston in 1962.

        <p>VISITORS to Davison Art Center, at Wesleyan University in Middletown, can see the pair of well-cut black riding boots -- or rather their silhouettes -- at 100 paces, hanging on the wall that faces the entrance of the gallery. The image is Jim Dine's and he produced it in 1965 at Universal Limited Art Editions, the print shop in West Islip, L.I., that was founded by Tanya Grosman in 1956 and first visited by Peter and Susan Ralston in 1962. Eventually the Ralstons acquired 78 prints, half of which now hang at the Davison under the title "30 Years at Universal Limited Art Editions," on view through Oct. 25.</p>
        <p>The Ralstons -- he is a Wesleyan alumnus and New York City real estate broker, she is an editor at Alfred Knopf -- started collecting soon after getting married and have not confined their patronage to the Long Island print shop. But as the show's curator, Stephen J. Lucey, notes in the catalogue, the Ralstons count among their treasures some of the most significant images pulled there and credit the workshop's proprietor with educating them in connoisseurship.  Born in Siberia</p>
        <p>Tanya Grosman's is a success story with miraculous aspects. It begins in the Siberia of 1904, where she was born, the daughter of a typographer. The story continues with immigration to Germany by way of Japan, in order to escape the Russian Revolution, with marriage to the painter Maurice Grosman in 1931, followed by a move to Paris, and in 1940, flight to Spain to avoid the German invasion of France. Three years later, the couple arrived in the United States and Maurice Grosman went to work making screen-print reproductions of works by Picasso, Matisse and other European artists until he had a heart attack. The Grosmans then moved from New York City to their summer house on Long Island.</p>
        <p>It was Tanya Grosman's idea that her husband turn his attention to contemporary American artists, and Mary Callery and Max Weber were the first to accept the invitation in the mid-1950's. It was then the couple discovered the lithography stones buried in their front lawn. By the early 1970's the print shop's repertory included virtually all the processes -- lithographs, woodcuts and etchings -- an artist would need. Stanley William Hayter had introduced the European concept of the fine art print when he relocated his Atelier 17 from Paris to New York City during World War II. But Tanya Grosman with her somewhat Vollardish ideas is credited with precipitating the American print renaissance.</p>
        <p>As the curator, Mr. Lucey, tells it, the shop began as a modest word-of-mouth operation: Larry Rivers, who collaborated with the poet Frank O'Hara, brought in Grace Hartigan, Helen Frankenthaler and Marisol. The late dealer John Bernard Myers introduced one of his artists, Robert Goodnough; Tanya Grosman herself attracted Jasper Johns's attention by lugging in lithography stones to his Manhattan studio and, in the process, meeting and persuading his neighbor Robert Rauschenberg to work with the shop. One by one, the cream of New York artists were given the run of the shop with printers at their beck and call, food, music and the unwavering attention of the hostess-entrepreneur. It was a golden age that ended with Tanya Grosman's death in 1982, and Mr. Lucey concludes with Calvin Tomkins's observation that, at the shop, "printmaking lost its stigma as a craft -- as minor art -- and became a legitimate form for the highest esthetic ambitions."</p>
        <p>The enterprise lives on under the direction of Bill Goldston, who is one of the master printers credited in the catalogue, along with Robert Blackburn, Ben Berns and others.</p>
        <p>Jasper Johns dominates the show numerically with 15 prints, 11 of them lithographs of the 1960's and 1970's: images like those of the coat hanger, the flag, paint brushes soaking in a Savarin coffee can and the rectangle filled with all-over cross hatching -- this an exceptionally fine print in black and gray on a lighter gray ground and, bordered in black. The remainder are etching-aquatints from "The Seasons," a mid-1980's series in which the artist recycles shapes like the silhouette of a figure (his own), a disembodied hand and the goblet with contours doubling as the profile of Picasso. Mr. Johns is as hermetic as ever in these designs but the naivete that has always been latent in his art is more obvious. Re-emergence of a Sculptor</p>
        <p>Mr. Rauschenberg is represented by seven prints of drawn and collage images including the monochrome portrait of Tanya Grosman taken from a photograph and combined with a rectangular palette form. Fritz Glarner, Robert Motherwell, Larry Rivers, Saul Steinberg, Cy Twombly and Susan Rothenberg are also present, together with Elizabeth Murray, whose lithograph suggesting an overturned table with carafes is remarkable for having required no fewer than 13 stones to produce.</p>
        <p>Most interestig, however, are the black and white prints of Lee Bontecou, a sculptor who was known during the 1960's for intimidating assemblages that evoked simultaneously associations with human orifices and machines but who is rarely seen nowadays. The most handsome of the images at the Davison tend to one or another of these extremes, notably the twin propeller shapes in the etching-aquatint "Fifth Stone, Sixth Stone: Plate VI" an illustration for poems by Tony Towle; "Eighth Stone," a lithograph of an eye shape surrounded by fleshy folds, and a lithograph, the more recent "Sixteenth Stone," a kind of geological cross section with layers inhabited by squid-like creatures. Ms. Bontecou could be a throwback to Odilon Redon.</p>
        <p>There is no question as to the high art status of all these prints but neither is there doubt as to the presence of the craftsmen aiding the artists.</p>
        <p>Also at the Davison through Oct. 25 is "20th-Century Linoleum Cuts," a show organized by William McCarthy that proves the linoleum cut is no longer child's play. Indeed, it has not been that since the 1920's, when, as Mr. McCarthy explains in a statement, Claude Power and his students at the Grosvenor School in London began exploring the medium with a view to color printing. The show, however, opens with Max Weber's 1913 nude, engraved white on a black ground. It also includes two prints atypical of the medium, one a 1920 scene of horses dragging lumber through a forest, by Ernest William Watson; the other a 1943 view of an estate in Princeton, by Louis Novak; both are beautifully colored.</p>
        <p>Simple as it is, the linocut lends itself to virtuosity -- witness "The King of Clowns," a poster in which Picasso used the reduction method.  That is, he cut first the white areas, printing the entire edition, before cutting and printing the brown and then the black. One thinks ahead with this procedure and there is no turning back. Chuck Close does the same thing with his portrait of Lucas Samaras, showing all the stages plus the final version. The show is nonetheless interesting for being a down-to-earth adjunct to the luxury of Universal Limited Art Editions.  ART</p>
