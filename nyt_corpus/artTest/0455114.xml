        <p>The art dealer Larry Gagosian likes to make offers that clients can't refuse. He once called Robert Half, a prominent collector in Beverly Hills, Calif., to ask if he would sell "Herald," a 1954 painting by Franz Kline that Mr. Half had cherished for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Half said no through three or four phone calls. Finally he asked what price was being offered by the buyer, identified as a mysterious Mr. Goldman.</p>
        <p>"Two million," Mr. Gagosian replied.</p>
        <p>"I told him the Kline wasn't worth it," Mr. Half said the other day.  "Then he offered me $2.5 million."</p>
        <p>A couple of calls later, Mr. Half reluctantly gave in. The buyer, Mr. Half said, was not "Mr. Goldman" at all, but S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing mogul, a regular Gagosian client known for paying top dollar.</p>
        <p>The 44-year-old Mr. Gagosian, who is not known as "Go-Go" for nothing, has brought millions of dollars' worth of art into play with such tactics. A fast-stepping dealmaker with a talented eye and a keen appetite for the hunt, he has risen from purveying decorative posters in Los Angeles in the mid-1970's to brokering art for high rollers like Mr. Newhouse and Charles Saatchi, the English advertising entrepreneur. His cocky presence, insatiable ambition and meteoric success in the resale market -- that is, works that are resold or traded after their original purchase -- have made him, for many, a symbol of the bullish 1980's, when artworks were traded like Wall Street commodities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagosian's operational style bears another resemblance to the 80's in his willingness to use leverage to keep his business growing. At a time when the art market is sharply down and most New York galleries are retrenching, he appears to be in a state of ebullient expansion, much of it financed by borrowing against his inventory. He is adding exhibition space to his headquarters, on Madison Avenue near 76th Street, and taking new digs in SoHo, primarily for large-scale sculpture. And he is giving his competitors additional heartburn by stepping into the more prestigious primary market, adding to his resale trade a small group of big-ticket artists whose new work he will show hot from the studio.</p>
        <p>In the gossipy, highly competitive art world, stories about Mr. Gagosian's driven behavior and sometimes corrosive relations with other dealers and clients proliferate, as do questions about his backing, his deal-making and what he owes to whom.</p>
        <p>But the most frequently asked question is, How does he do it?</p>
        <p>"Larry hustles," said Stanley Grinstein, a Los Angeles collector. "But you know right away that he's hustling, and he doesn't try to hide it. It's part of his charm."</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Gagosian wooed the painter David Salle away from a 12-year relationship with the Mary Boone Gallery. More recently he snatched the painter Philip Taaffe away from Ms. Boone after she had already advertised his show for her gallery. And he has been courting such superstars as Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, Brice Marden and Sigmar Polke. His latest acquisition is Francesco Clemente, the Italian painter whose new work he will show uptown in the fall.</p>
        <p>Although questions have been raised about whether Mr. Gagosian is too heavily leveraged, his life style bespeaks affluence. A dapper figure whose steel-gray hair is styled in a "power" cut, he wears the Armani suits that are the uniform of the trade and, like other big-league dealers, he is driven around in a limousine from which he works deals on a cellular phone.</p>
        <p>He has a personal collection of Abstract Expressionism, Pop and the work of artists he represents; an elegant town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, formerly owned by Christophe de Menil, the fashion designer and Schlumberger heiress, and a spectacular modernist mansion overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in Amagansett, L.I., that was designed by the architect Charles Gwathmey for Francois de Menil, Christophe's brother.</p>
        <p>The guest lists at these homes include such luminaries as Lee Radziwill Ross; Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir and former United States Ambassador to Austria; Leo Castelli, the art dealer, and Peter M. Brant, the newsprint magnate, whose release from jail last December after time served for income tax evasion was celebrated with a dinner party chez Gagosian.</p>
        <p>"But I think there is a certain Gatsby quality to his life," said one of his guests, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "He is still the outsider looking in, determined to impress with his wealth and power."</p>
        <p>In the last few years Mr. Gagosian has taken steps to enhance his cultural image while at the same time cultivating star artists of the resale market. He has earned critical kudos for a series of museum-quality "historical" exhibitions focused on the earlier phases of the careers of such artists as Brancusi, Cy Twombly, Brice Marden, Roy Lichtenstein, Willem de Kooning and Frank Stella. Seeking Clients With Power</p>
        <p>It is in his role as the most aggressive trader in the resale market, however, that Mr. Gagosian has made his mark. As a neophyte dealer in Los Angeles, where he was born and grew up, he lacked capital for an inventory of his own, or to develop a stable of younger artists. As he got to know the art world, however, he sensed the growing eagerness of collectors to trade up and turn over their artworks faster than was possible through auction houses or galleries.</p>
        <p>He began to ferret out desirable pieces, talking their owners into selling or trading, then -- acting as middleman -- purveying them to other clients at commissions ranging from 2 to 10 percent. "I don't like to sell paintings to museums," Mr. Gagosian once told a fellow dealer, "because then I can't get them back."</p>
        <p>Often phoning prospects cold, Mr. Gagosian worked his way up to such resale clients as Burton and Emily Tremaine, from whose celebrated collection of post-World War II art he sold prizes like Piet Mondrian's "Victory Boogie-Woogie," to Mr. Newhouse for a price reported to be $11 million. He also developed ties to Mr. Saatchi, whom he has represented in numerous deals in recent years.</p>
        <p>"He moved in a careful, clear way, sought out major collectors, and saw who was buying and what," said Douglas Cramer, the television producer, who is a longtime Gagosian client. "He has a wonderful eye, an encyclopedic memory, and knows what's vulnerable to a trade."</p>
        <p>But although Mr. Gagosian receives high marks for hard work and a good eye, some colleagues who have been involved in deals with him complain that they have been burned. Reports of Deals Gone Bad</p>
        <p>A dealer who spoke only on condition of anonymity told of Mr. Gagosian's pressing him for a painting and a drawing by Robert Mangold for a certain client.</p>
        <p>"I sold him the Mangolds because I wanted to get them into that collection," the dealer said. "But I told him I needed to borrow the painting back later for a major show. A couple of weeks later, it turned up on the market. He hadn't sold it to the collector at all. Now I wouldn't sell him anything in the way of new work."</p>
        <p>Asked about this case, Mr. Gagosian said, "It could have happened in any number of permutations, but I don't recall it."</p>
        <p>Robert Feldman, the owner of Parasol Press, which publishes original graphics and sells art only to dealers, said that after several transactions with Mr. Gagosian involving late payments and bounced checks, in 1988 he sold him a painting by Robert Ryman for $80,000. "Knowing Larry, I took the precaution of getting a check from him before giving him the painting," he said.</p>
        <p>That same day, Mr. Feldman said, the painting was returned with no explanation. And Mr. Gagosian had stopped payment on the check. "I figured he had a client for the work who turned out not to want it," Mr. Feldman said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gagosian hotly disputed Mr. Feldman's version of the story. "He misrepresented the painting to me," Mr. Gagosian said. "He said it hadn't been on the market, but the first client I called had been offered it before, and for less money. Then I found it had been peddled all over the place at a lower price than what I'd paid. So I called him and said I was sending it back."</p>
        <p>He denied Mr. Feldman's statement that the two had had unsatisfactory dealings. "He never had any problems with me," Mr. Gagosian said. "Like a lot of other people, he just seems to resent the fact that I've been a success."</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldman replied: "I made no representation to him as to whether the painting -- which I owned -- had been offered for sale before. It was in fact brought to Gagosian's attention by the Fred Hoffman Gallery in Los Angeles, which had been told of it by the Gallery Tanit in Munich. So Gagosian certainly knew that at least two other dealers were aware of the painting.</p>
        <p>"I never offered it to anyone at a lower price. In fact, I sold the painting after its return for more, to another dealer. Nor did he -- despite what he said -- call me before he sent it back. As for his denial that he had unsatisfactory dealings with me, I will stand up in court with my records."</p>
        <p>In the mid-1970's, Mr. Gagosian was engaged to Catherine Kerr, formerly a dancer with the Merce Cunningham group. Ms. Kerr recalled that after the couple broke up, he urged her to buy a drawing from Jasper Johns, at that time artistic director of the Cunningham company, for Mr. Gagosian to sell. "The idea was that I would ostensibly buy it, but he would pay for it and then sell it," Ms. Kerr recalled. "I told him that I wouldn't do that."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagosian said: "Even though Johns was artistic director of the company, she didn't have that kind of access to him. I might have said, 'I'd like to meet him; why don't you bring him to the gallery?' because at the time my own access was very limited. I don't recall anything resembling her story, but anyway there's nothing wrong with the scenario. I wouldn't object to it." Debt Managed With Creativity</p>
        <p>As prices shot up in the 1980's -- helped by his own wheeling and dealing -- so did Mr. Gagosian's prestige. In the late 1970's, still living in California, he bought a SoHo loft -- for $10,000 and a Brice Marden painting -- and began to mount shows there, including the work of David Salle. In 1985, he moved his business from Los Angeles to New York, impeccably renovating a ground-level truck dock on West 23d Street. In 1989 he moved to the high-rent district, taking bigger quarters on the sixth floor of the former Sotheby building at 980 Madison Avenue, which he turned into a high-tech space that projects a distinctly corporate image.</p>
        <p>There he has a staff of 16. He is currently expanding his exhibition space to the floor below, adding a huge gallery that will bring his total space to about 10,000 square feet. He also shares a gallery in SoHo at 65 Thompson Street with Mr. Castelli, and says that he will open another "garage space" in the fall, reportedly at Prince and Wooster Streets in SoHo. For some time he had planned to open at 575 Broadway, but the space proved unsuitable for large-scale sculpture.</p>
        <p>Despite these expansions, Mr. Gagosian's finances continue to be a favorite topic of rumor and speculation in the art world. Public records in Manhattan indicate that banks are holding as collateral liens on a number of of star paintings in his inventory, including works by Jackson Pollock, Cy Twombly, Sam Francis, Roy Lichtenstein, Brice Marden, Frank Stella, Barnett Newman, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol. Some of the paintings under lien are worth millions of dollars, like Jackson Pollock's "Scent," a large oil dated 1953 to 1955, that dealers value today at about $8 million.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Chemical Bank, which holds many of the liens, refused to comment specifically on its dealings with Mr. Gagosian but said that the bank did make loans and opened lines of credit to dealers based on the value of their inventories. It is not "customary practice" to take liens on individual paintings, the spokesman, Kenneth Herz, said, but it is done "selectively, where works of art have a widely acknowledged market value." He added, "It reflects well on someone if we have this kind of relationship, because we feel he is a good businessman and has his finger on the pulse of the market."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, more conservative dealers avoid borrowing on their inventory, a practice banks did not become widely involved in before the 1980's. "It's aggressive on Larry's part to leverage to this extent, considering some of today's lowered price levels," said a dealer, who would speak only on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>In today's softer market, are these paintings still worth what Mr. Gagosian paid for them in the 80's? "I could sell one painting even at today's prices and pay off my entire obligation to the bank," said Mr. Gagosian, who refused to discuss the amount of that obligation. "I'm at a level that is very comfortable for my business."</p>
        <p>A transaction record filed in March in the New York City Registry that mentions an assignment agreement between Mr. Gagosian and Mr. Saatch indicates that Mr. Gagosian owes money to Sotheby's , although the amount is not mentioned. Mr. Gagosian said he had "an ongoing financial arrangement" with the auction house.</p>
        <p>But Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America, said the auction house had no "blanket commitment" to Mr. Gagosian. "From time to time we have engaged in specific loan transactions with him," she said.</p>
        <p>In satisfaction of the loan, Mr. Gagosian said he had pledged some commissions due him from the sale of art owned by Mr. Saatchi. Mitchell Zuckerman, president of Sotheby's Financial Services, said the auction house had "structured some financing" for Mr. Gagosian, as it did for other dealers. "He informed us he was expecting payments from Saatchi, and so he redirected them to us," Mr. Zuckerman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagosian says, however: "I've got plenty of money. Business is still good, although not as good as six months or a year ago. I do have to work harder.</p>
        <p>"Besides, even though debt has become a dirty word after the 1980's, a prudent use of it is the only way you can really grow. I think, in using various arrangements to sustain my business, I've actually handled it rather creatively." Business Friends, But 'No Backers'</p>
        <p>Mr. Saatchi, a close friend, is not a backer of his gallery, Mr. Gagosian said. Mr. Saatchi began to buy art from him some years ago when he was building his collection, the dealer added. "He likes me and we get along well," Mr. Gagosian said. "I think he chose me to represent him because I had a feel for the art he was involved in, and he thought I could do the job."</p>
        <p>Indeed, in a relatively short time, Mr. Gagosian managed to sell a good deal of Mr. Saatchi's art at respectable prices, and, as one colleague put it, "without a lot of people knowing what had happened."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagosian also has a close business and social relationship with Mr. Newhouse, the chairman of Advance Publications , which owns Random House Inc. and Conde Nast. At an auction at Sotheby's in 1988, at which Mr. Gagosian bought Jasper Johns's "False Start" for Mr. Newhouse for $17 million, the collector sat next to the dealer, visibly instructing him on the bidding. "It's no secret that we work together," Mr. Gagosian said. "His business and friendship are extremely important to me."</p>
        <p>But both men deny that Mr. Newhouse is Mr. Gagosian's backer. "There are moments when I wish I were," Mr. Newhouse said with a laugh the other day, "but I'm not in the business of running an art gallery."</p>
        <p>"I have no backers," Mr. Gagosian said.</p>
        <p>The mantle -- and the stable -- that he would like to inherit in the art world is that of his closest dealer friend, Mr. Castelli, who has helped build the careers of Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists who are today household names.</p>
        <p>"Larry is very intelligent, very enterprising, and does wonderful shows, besides having great business acumen," Mr. Castelli said.</p>
        <p>If there is mutual admiration between the suave, European-born dealer and the brash Californian, there is also a symbiotic relationship. Mr. Gagosian's high profits from the resale market have come in part from Mr. Castelli's long and arduous efforts to build the reputations of these now world-famous artists.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Gagosian's activities in that market have helped to boost the prices that Mr. Castelli and others are able to charge for the artists' newer work.</p>
        <p>"I'm more like Leo than you think," Mr. Gagosian said, "and Leo's like me." He laughed. "Maybe if we were coming up together he wouldn't speak so kindly of me."</p>
