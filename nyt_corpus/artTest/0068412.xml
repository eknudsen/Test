        <p>ARTISTS THINKING ABOUT AU-guste Rodin? In 1987? Artists of all kinds, spanning several generations, drawn to a heroic figure in an analytical, unromantic age? Listen to Robert Longo, whose large mixed-media works reflecting upon the power of images and sounds are not normally identified either with Rodin or with European art:</p>
        <p>''After quitting school in 1972, I went to Italy for five months and looked at the archetypal artists like Michelangelo and Cellini. When I got to Paris, I went to the Louvre and there, too, nothing really affected me. When I got to the Rodin Museum, it was like everything hit and lined up in order. I ended up going there every day and doing all the things an artist is supposed to do, staying on the lawn, drawing sculpture, reading about Rodin. It was like being aware of being an artist for the first time. When I went back there this summer, it was eerie. I saw works of mine coming out of sculptures by Rodin I had not remembered even having seen.''</p>
        <p>This is only one indication that contemporary artists are more involved with Rodin than art professionals might expect. Indeed, there was almost no trace of him and his followers in the two major modern sculpture surveys in 1985 and 1986, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Pompidou Center in Paris. Both shows were informed by the belief that in order to be serious and influential, and to compete with painting, modern sculpture had to liberate itself from the tradition of monolithic figurative statuary and involve itself primarily with its own materials and language.</p>
        <p>Beyond the boundaries of this Formalist esthetic, however, Rodin has always been present. Indeed, it would be hard for sculptors involved with narrative, sentiment, sexuality and the expressive possibilities of the human figure - most of which Formalism was determined to banish from art - not to consider him.</p>
        <p>In the thoroughness and vitality of his modeling; in his search for grandiose narrative schemes that could reflect a sense of fragmentation and incompleteness; in his worship of matter and spirit, the human body and the Gothic cathedral; in his attraction both to uniqueness and duplication, originality and repetition, and in his strange hybrid constructions, combining different sculptures and different stages of the sculptural process, Rodin is a force too complex, controversial and abundant ever to go away.</p>
        <p>This is apparent in the statements of artists from 34 to 65 years old who have recently had occasion to speak about Rodin. In conjunction with a major exhibition of ''Rodin Sculpture and Drawings'' at the Hayward Gallery in London last winter, the Arts Council of Great Britain asked the English sculptor Raymond Mason to give a talk. In conjunction with the Sept. 18 inauguration of a permanent installation of 58 sculptures by Rodin at the Brooklyn Museum - a gift from Iris and B. Gerald Kantor - the curator Lynne Ambrosini invited three contemporary sculptors, Bryan Hunt, Alain Kirili and Jonathan Silver, to discuss Rodin in front of his works. The interviews will be published in the accompanying catalogue.</p>
        <p>It is not that the observations of these artists are new. What is significant is that with the exception of Hunt, who remains interested but somewhat detached, their words are passionate and engaged. Among sculptors who model clay, plaster or wax, there is close attention to the way Rodin worked his surfaces and controlled light. In all the artists, there is a keen awareness of the importance of drawing and process.</p>
        <p>Nothing has more of an edge than the discussions of the sexuality in Rodin's work. As conscious as Rodin was of himself as a sculptor, his work is in some way about the possibility and necessity of abandonment. Nothing about his work is more sharply in contrast with the artistic and critical self-consciousness of this age. His sculptures and drawings of the female nude are marked by a trust in desire and flesh that may have been unprecedented. Catherine Lampert, the curator of the London show, remarks in the catalogue that Rodin was ''lecherous.'' She also writes that Rodin was ''the first sculptor to want to make women's sexuality important.''</p>
        <p>The artists involved in these talks and interviews are very different. Kirili is the only one whose work is largely abstract. He is a compatriot of Rodin who has been living in the United States for several years. He models in clay and terra cotta. His assemblages may include wood. The works for which he is best known are in iron. In his recent forged-aluminum sculptures, he has been searching for an effect that is at the same time restrained and orgiastic.</p>
        <p>Hunt was one of the first American sculptors coming out of Minimal, Conceptual and earth art to sense the possibilities of bronze, and his flowing sculptures contain allusions to natural processes and the human figure. One of the casts of Rodin's ''Balzac'' at the Los Angeles County Museum was ''actually the first sculpture I ever encountered in my life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Silver and Mason are the sculptors most involved with modeling, and they are the most thoughtful about Rodin's working methods. Both work slowly. Silver is a sculptural descendant of Rodin, one of the artists most affected by what Ms. Lampert described as Rodin's ''radical absence of decorum.'' He will include in his disjunctive, syncretic constructions any aspect from any stage of the casting process. Like Rodin, he makes numerous plaster casts, remodels them, rips them apart, incorporates them in new works, has the new works cast, breaks them up, reassembles the parts, and so on in an endless process of creation and destruction.</p>
        <p>Mason is 65 years old, he has lived in Paris for 40 years, and his words, like the eccentric, knobby figures inhabiting his narrative reliefs, have a curious combination of oversimplification and subtlety. He categorically dismisses Minimal Art, Conceptual Art and Arte Povera, as well as almost all art of the past 25 years. He is the only one of these artists at ease with Rodin's grandiose ambition and with the idea of the masterpiece. Rodin's ''Burghers of Calais'' was an inspiration for his ''Illuminated Crowd,'' installed in front of the Esso Building in Montreal, the most ambitious outdoor figurative sculpture in recent years.</p>
        <p>For these artists, the sexuality of Rodin's work is a primary issue. In one version of ''Balzac,'' the phallus of the bulbous standing figure seems to grow out of the earth like a root. Like the monumental ''Balzac,'' Rodin's ''Monument to Victor Hugo,'' with muses clumped around the naked figure like angels and furies, caused a scandal. ''Rodin was no longer looking for a symbol of gentle, cerebral inspiration but for a way of visualizing how untamed carnal energy stoked the fires of creative drive,'' Ms. Lampert writes of this work.</p>
        <p>For Silver, this uninhibited, unconflicted sexuality is part of what makes Rodin alien. ''There's that kind of love of female flesh as an object of lust and dominating, colonizing sensuality, expressed throughout Rodin's work, which is not particularly sympathetic to modern attitudes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''What I'm getting at is not so much that Rodin's work is sexist per se, but that most contemporary art lacks sensuality. It's often preoccupied with erotic subject matter, but it lacks a direct, physical sensuality. It's much more detached, ironical, and that's why I think that Rodin doesn't address us directly.''</p>
        <p>Longo talks about Rodin's ''Kiss'' and his own use of the kiss as a motif. He makes a provocative distinction between the coolness of sculptures by Rodin in which couples are embracing and individual images of women, such as ''Iris, Messenger of the Gods,'' which for him have real heat. If the single images are more erotic than the couples, it is surely because part of the couple could be imaginatively occupied by Rodin himself.</p>
        <p>For Kirili, the erotic dimension of Rodin is something of a cause. His book on Rodin's erotic drawings, with texts by him and the French writer Philippe Sollers, was published earlier this year in France. Kirili is profoundly aware how out of place Rodin's ''Dionysian vision'' has been in recent American art.</p>
        <p>He believes that the sexuality of Rodin's art is of paramount importance to an appropriate understanding of the artist. Only this can make it possible to understand the ''scandalous side of Rodin,'' ''the obscene Rodin,'' as well as his ''audacity and transgressions.'' Only this, he believes, can enable us to understand the radical dimension of Rodin's work, the dimension that continues to make the art establishment uneasy.</p>
        <p>For him, the sculpture of ''Balzac,'' with its blend of spirituality and sexuality, is a model. In it ''creative genius is inseparable from sexuality, a vision that means a lot to artists like me at a time when the development of art is envisioned solely in terms of its 'own' issues - a fundamentally formalist and asexual vision.''</p>
        <p>The sexuality in Rodin's sculptures and drawings grows out of a feeling for nature. Rodin was born into a century in which nature could still be a guide, and when the threat to nature from industry could lead some artists to treat it as a religion. His work is studded with ideas of generation, regeneration, abundance and fertility. He worked from nature in order to be guided by and partake of it. Along with other 19th-century artists like Delacroix, Courbet and Monet, Rodin became in some sense a force of nature.</p>
        <p>While Kirili is concerned with the active, volcanic way Rodin set out almost to become nature, Mason feels that what has been forgotten is a reverence for nature that links Rodin to Cezanne. He blames the oversight on the need of modernism to use the past to serve its own ends. ''The current tendency,'' Mason said, is to build up ''the late Rodin because the more arms and legs he saws off, the nearer he resembles Brancusi.''</p>
        <p>''In a similar way Cezanne is assimilated into modernism - the first Cubist! Yet Picasso and Braque threw immediately out of the window the essential nature of Cezanne, the 'receuillement,' the contemplative prayer. He painted nature all his life almost on his knees as an act of worship.''</p>
        <p>''What I can say about Cezanne can be said about Rodin.''</p>
        <p>For Silver, Rodin was strongest when working from nature. He points out that Rodin used very wet clay -which gives the earth an even more suggestive and elemental feel. The wetter the clay, the more responsive it is to the artist's touch, the surer the artist must be of the current between earth, model, hand and eye.</p>
        <p>''For me,'' Silver said, ''the closer he is to a life scale and the more attentive he is to his model, the more I am responsive to his work, because I think that he drew his vitality directly from his observations. His work gets progressively weaker as it gets larger and more literary.''</p>
        <p>''When he worked on a human scale, he didn't just imitate form but dealt with the stresses of modern life on the individual as seen directly, in their impress on human flesh. That's where he's a master psychologist.'' Silver said that a subject like Rodin's mistress, ''is highly personal. It has a physical, sensual apprehension of a psychological state which is expressed in the face.''</p>
        <p>This sensual responsiveness to the world around him, and the intoxication with which he was capable of participating physically in his sculpture help make Rodin a profound, prolific and problematical figure who is impossible to forget.</p>
        <p>''People label Rodin a frightful man, the man who bullied Camille Claudel,'' said Kirili, referring to the sculptor, colleague and mistress of Rodin who went mad and who is believed by some authorities - not Catherine Lampert - to have been destroyed by him. ''But it's time to realize how his figures of female bodies express jouissance'' (which the Brooklyn Museum catalogue defines as ''intense enjoyment, especially sexual'').</p>
