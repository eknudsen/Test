This archive contains two directories, "art" and "music", containing a random
selection of stories from the _New York Times Annotated Corpus_ which were
tagged as being about, respectively, art and music.  See the handout for
lecture 1, and the links therein, for more information about the corpus.  All
news stories and their annotations are copyright by the New York Times, and
while they can be used for the education purposes of this class, they are NOT
